haven’t done much rapping before it was not a deliberate decision.. we had written the song and i had come in to record it and then the guys were like why don’t we just try rapping this part so i did and then it kind of just worked and we decided to keep it so not intentional but sometimes things just happen in the moment 6 critical reception edit hurricane has been compared to the works of cher

heat transfer coefficient wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the heat transfer coefficient or film coefficient or film effectiveness in thermodynamics and in mechanics is the proportionality constant between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat i.e. the temperature difference Δt h q Δ t displaystyle h frac q delta t where q amount of heat transferred heat flux w m2 i.e. thermal power per unit area q d q ˙ displaystyle dot q da h heat transfer coefficient w m2•k Δt difference in temperature between the solid surface and surrounding fluid area k it is used in calculating the heat transfer typically by convection or phase transition between a fluid and a solid the heat transfer coefficient has si units in watts per squared meter kelvin w m2k the heat transfer coefficient is the reciprocal of thermal insulance this is used for building materials r-value and for clothing insulation there are numerous methods for calculating the heat transfer coefficient in different heat transfer modes different fluids flow regimes and under different thermohydraulic conditions often it can be estimated by dividing the thermal conductivity of the convection fluid by a length scale the heat transfer coefficient is often calculated from the nusselt number a dimensionless number there are also online calculators available specifically for heat transfer fluid applications experimental assessment of the heat transfer coefficient poses some challenges especially when small fluxes are to be measured e.g 0.2 w c m

buildings or across heat exchangers is shown below note that this method only accounts for conduction within materials it does not take into account heat transfer through methods such as radiation the method is as follows 1 u ⋅ a 1 h 1 ⋅ a 1 d x w k ⋅ a 1 h 2 ⋅ a 2 displaystyle 1 u cdot a 1 h 1 cdot a 1 dx w k cdot a 1 h 2 cdot a 2 where u displaystyle u the overall heat transfer coefficient w m2•k

to be noted that often the value for d x w displaystyle dx w is referred to as the difference of two radii where the inner and outer radii are used to define the thickness of a pipe carrying a fluid however this figure may also be considered as a wall thickness in a flat plate transfer mechanism or other common flat surfaces such as a wall in a building when the area difference between each edge of the transmission surface approaches zero in the walls of buildings the above formula can be used to derive the formula commonly used to calculate the heat through building components architects and engineers call the resulting values either the u-value or the r-value of a construction assembly like a wall each type of value r or u are related as the inverse of each other such that r-value 1 u-value and both are more fully understood through the concept of an overall heat transfer coefficient described in lower section of this document convective heat transfer correlations edit although convective heat transfer can be derived analytically through dimensional analysis exact analysis of the boundary layer approximate integral analysis of the boundary layer and analogies between energy and momentum transfer these analytic approaches may not offer practical solutions to all problems when there are no mathematical models applicable therefore many correlations were developed by various authors to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient in various cases including natural convection forced convection for internal flow and forced convection for external flow these empirical

particularly simple correlation useful for many applications this correlation is applicable when forced convection is the only mode of heat transfer i.e. there is no boiling condensation significant radiation etc the accuracy of this correlation is anticipated to be ±15 for a fluid flowing in a straight circular pipe with a reynolds number between 10,000 and 120,000 in the turbulent pipe flow range when the fluid s prandtl number is between 0.7 and 120 for a location far from the pipe entrance more than 10 pipe diameters more than 50 diameters according to many authors 7 or other flow

external flow edit in analyzing the heat transfer associated with the flow past the exterior surface of a solid the situation is complicated by phenomena such as boundary layer separation various authors have correlated charts and graphs for different geometries and flow conditions for flow parallel to a plane surface where x displaystyle x is the distance from the edge and l displaystyle l is the height of the boundary layer a mean nusselt number can be calculated using the colburn analogy 6 thom correlation edit there exist simple fluid-specific correlations for heat transfer coefficient in boiling the thom correlation is for the flow of boiling water subcooled or saturated at pressures up to about 20 mpa under conditions where the nucleate boiling contribution predominates over forced convection this correlation is useful for rough estimation of expected temperature difference given the heat flux 9 Δ t s a t 22.5 ⋅ q 0.5 exp ⁡ − p 8.7 displaystyle delta t sat 22.5 cdot q 0.5

correlation is specific to the units given heat transfer coefficient of pipe wall edit the resistance to the flow of heat by the material of pipe wall can be expressed as a heat transfer coefficient of the pipe wall however one needs to select if the heat flux is based on the pipe inner or the outer diameter selecting to base the heat flux on the pipe inner diameter and assuming that the pipe wall thickness is small in comparison with the pipe inner diameter then the heat transfer coefficient for the pipe wall can be calculated as if the wall were not curved citation needed h w a l l k x displaystyle h wall k over x where k is the effective thermal conductivity of the wall material and x is the wall thickness if the above assumption does not hold then the wall heat transfer

heat transfer coefficient u displaystyle u is a measure of the overall ability of a series of conductive and convective barriers to transfer heat it is commonly applied to the calculation of heat transfer in heat exchangers but can be applied equally well to other problems for the case of a heat exchanger u displaystyle u can be used to determine the total heat transfer between the two streams in the heat exchanger by the following relationship q u a Δ t l m displaystyle q ua delta t lm where q displaystyle q heat transfer rate w u displaystyle u overall heat transfer coefficient w m²·k a displaystyle a heat transfer surface area m2 Δ t l m displaystyle delta t lm logarithmic mean temperature difference k the overall heat transfer coefficient takes into account the individual heat transfer coefficients of each stream and the resistance of the pipe material it can be calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of a series of thermal resistances but more complex relationships exist for example when heat transfer takes place by different routes in parallel 1 u a ∑ 1 h a ∑ r displaystyle frac 1 ua sum frac 1 ha sum r where r resistance s to heat flow in pipe wall k w other parameters are as above 12 the heat transfer coefficient is the heat transferred per unit area per kelvin thus area is included in the equation as it represents the area over which the transfer of heat takes place the areas for each flow will be different as they represent the contact area for each fluid side the thermal resistance due to the pipe wall is calculated by the following relationship r x k ⋅ a displaystyle r frac x k cdot a where x the wall thickness m k the thermal conductivity of the material w m·k a the total area of the heat exchanger m2 this represents the heat transfer by conduction in the pipe the thermal conductivity is a characteristic of the particular material values of thermal conductivities for various materials are listed in the list of thermal conductivities as mentioned earlier in the article the convection heat transfer coefficient for each stream depends on the type of fluid flow properties and temperature properties some typical heat transfer coefficients include air h 10 to 100 w m2k water h 500 to 10,000 w m2k thermal resistance due to fouling deposits edit often during their use heat exchangers collect a layer of fouling on the surface which in addition to potentially contaminating a stream reduces the effectiveness of heat exchangers in a fouled heat exchanger the buildup on the walls creates an additional layer of materials that heat must flow through due to this new layer there is additional resistance within the heat exchanger and thus the overall heat transfer coefficient of the exchanger is reduced the following relationship is used to solve for the heat transfer resistance with the additional fouling resistance 13 1 u f p displaystyle frac 1 u f p 1 u p r f h p h r f c p c displaystyle frac 1 up

displaystyle p does not matter as long as it is the same the overall heat transfer coefficients will adjust to take into account that a different perimeter was used as the product u p displaystyle up will remain the same the fouling resistances can be calculated for a specific heat exchanger if the average thickness and thermal conductivity of the fouling are known the product of the average

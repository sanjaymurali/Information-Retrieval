la niña wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for the ship see niña sea surface skin temperature anomalies in november 2007 showing la niña conditions la niña lɑːˈniːnjə spanish pronunciation   la ˈniɲa is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that is the counterpart of el niño as part of the broader el niño–southern oscillation climate pattern the name la niña originates from spanish meaning the little girl analogous to el niño meaning the little boy it has also in the past been called anti-el niño citation needed and el viejo meaning the old man 1 during a period of la niña the sea surface temperature across the equatorial eastern central pacific ocean will be lower than normal by 3 to 5 °c in the united states an appearance of la niña persists for at least five months it has extensive effects on the weather in north america even affecting the atlantic hurricane season definition edit la niña is the positive phase of the el niño southern oscillation and is associated with cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean 2 however each country and island nation has a different threshold for what constitutes a la niña event which is tailored to their specific interests 3 for example the australian bureau of meteorology looks at the trade winds soi weather models and sea surface temperatures in the niño 3 and 3.4 regions before declaring that a la niña event has started 4 however the japan meteorological agency declares that a la niña event has started when the average five-month sea surface temperature deviation for the nino.3 region is more than 0.5 °c 0.90 °f cooler for 6 consecutive months or longer 5 occurrences edit a timeline of all la niña episodes between 1900 and 2017 6 7 there was a relatively strong la niña episode during 1988–1989 la niña also formed in late 1983 8 in 1995 and a protracted la niña event that lasted from mid-1998 through early 2001 this was followed by a neutral period between 2001 and 2002 the la niña which developed in mid-2007 and lasted until almost 2009 was a moderate one the strength of la niña made the 2008 atlantic hurricane season one of the five most active since 1944 sixteen named storms had winds of at least 39 miles per hour 63 km h eight of which became 74-mile-per-hour 119 km h or greater hurricanes 9 a new la niña episode developed quite quickly in the eastern and central tropical pacific in mid-2010 10 and lasted until early 2011 11 it intensified again in mid-2011 and lasted until early 2012 12 this la niña combined with record-high ocean temperatures in the north-eastern indian ocean was a large factor in the 2010–2011 queensland floods 13 and the quartet of recent heavy snowstorms in north america starting with the december 2010 north american blizzard the same la niña event was also a likely cause of a series of tornadoes of above-average severity that struck the midwestern and southern united states in the spring of 2011 and drought conditions in the south central states including texas oklahoma and arkansas 14 meanwhile a series of major storms caused extensive flooding in california in december 2010 with seven consecutive days of non-stop rainfall leading to one of the wettest decembers in over 120 years of records this is in contrast to the drier-than-normal conditions typically associated with la niña in california 15 in 2011 on a global scale la niña events helped keep the average global temperature below recent trends as a result 2011 tied with 1997 for the eleventh-warmest year on record it was the second-coolest year of the 21st century to date and tied with the second-warmest year of the 20th century a relatively strong phase of la niña opened the year dissipated in the spring before re-emerging in october and lasted through the end of the year when compared to previous la niña years the 2011 global surface temperature was the warmest observed the 2011 globally-averaged precipitation over land was the second-wettest year on record behind 2010 precipitation varied greatly across the globe this la niña contributed to severe drought in east africa and to australia s third-wettest year in its 112-year period of records 16 la niñas occurred in 1904 1908 1910 1916 1924 1928 1938 1949–51 17 1954–56 1964 1970–72 1973–76 1983–85 8 1988–89 1995–96 1998–2001 2007–08 2010–12 and 2016–17 10 18 19 impacts on the global climate edit la niña impacts the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others 20 regional impacts edit observations of la niña events since 1950 show that impacts associated with la niña events depend on what season it is 21 however while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events it is not certain or guaranteed that they will occur 21 africa edit between 50,000 and 100,000 people died during the 2011 horn of africa drought 22 la niña results in wetter-than-normal conditions in southern africa from december to february and drier-than-normal conditions over equatorial east africa over the same period 23 asia edit during la niña years the formation of tropical cyclones along with the subtropical ridge position shifts westward across the western pacific ocean which increases the landfall threat to china 24 in march 2008 la niña caused a drop in sea surface temperatures over southeast asia by 2 °c it also caused heavy rains over malaysia the philippines and indonesia 25 north america edit regional impacts of la niña la niña causes mostly the opposite effects of el niño above-average precipitation across the northern midwest the northern rockies northern california and the pacific northwest s southern and eastern regions meanwhile precipitation in the southwestern and southeastern states is below average 26 this also allows for the development of many stronger-than-average hurricanes in the atlantic and fewer in the pacific the synoptic condition for tehuantepecer winds is associated with high-pressure system forming in sierra madre of mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front which causes winds to accelerate through the isthmus of tehuantepec tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts between october and february with a summer maximum in july caused by the westward extension of the azores-bermuda high pressure system wind magnitude is weaker during la niña years than el niño years due to the less frequent cold frontal incursions during la niña winters 27 with its effects can last from a few hours to six days 28 in canada la niña will in general cause a cooler snowier winter such as the near-record-breaking amounts of snow recorded in la niña winter of 2007 2008 in eastern canada 29 30 south america edit during a time of la niña drought plagues the coastal regions of peru and chile 31 from december to february northern brazil is wetter than normal 31 la niña causes higher than normal rainfall in the central andes which in turn causes catastrophic flooding on the llanos de mojos of beni department bolivia such flooding is documented from 1853 1865 1872 1873 1886 1895 1896 1907 1921 1928 1929 and 1931 32 diversity edit map showing niño3.4 and other index regions the traditional la niña also called eastern pacific ep la niña 33 involves temperature anomalies in the eastern pacific however in the last two decades nontraditional la niña were observed in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly niño 1 and 2 is not affected but an anomaly arises in the central pacific niño 3.4 34 the phenomenon is called central pacific cp la niña 33 dateline la niña because the anomaly arises near the dateline or la niña modoki modoki is japanese for similar but different 35 36 there are flavors of enso additional to ep and cp types and some scientists argue that enso exists as a continuum often with hybrid types 37 the effects of the cp la niña are different from those of the traditional ep la niña—e.g. the recently discovered la niña leads to a rainfall increase over northwestern australia and northern murray-darling basin rather than over the east as in a conventional la niña 36 also la niña modoki increases the frequency of cyclonic storms over bay of bengal but decreases the occurrence of severe storms in the indian ocean overall with the arabian sea becoming severely non-conductive to tropical cyclone formation 38 39 the recent discovery of enso modoki has some scientists believing it to be linked to global warming 40 however comprehensive satellite data go back only to 1979 generally there is no scientific consensus on how if climate change may affect enso 41 there is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this new enso a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence or both either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a distinction 42 43 finding no distinction or trend using other statistical approaches 44 45 46 47 48 or that other types should be distinguished such as standard and extreme enso 49 50 recent years when la niña modoki events occurred include 1973–74 1975–76 1983–84 1988–89 1998–99 2000–01 2008–09 2010–11 and 2016–17 35 51 52

low-pressure center a closed low-level atmospheric circulation strong winds and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain depending on its location and strength a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names including hurricane ˈhʌrɪkən keɪn 1 2 3 typhoon taɪˈfuːn tropical storm cyclonic storm tropical depression and simply cyclone 4 a hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the atlantic ocean and northeastern pacific ocean a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean and a cyclone occurs in the south pacific or indian ocean 4 tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water they derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation this energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms such as nor easters and european windstorms which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts the strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the earth s rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation as a result they rarely form within 5° of the equator 5 tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km 62 and 1,243 mi in diameter they are far less common south of the equator mainly because the african easterly jet warmer waters and areas of atmospheric instability which gives rise to cyclones in the atlantic ocean and americas occur in the northern hemisphere and because vertical wind shear is much stronger south of the equator which typically prevents tropical depressions and potential storms from developing into cyclones tropical refers to the geographical origin of these systems which form almost exclusively over tropical seas cyclone refers to their winds moving in a circle 6 whirling round their central clear eye with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and blowing clockwise in the southern hemisphere the opposite direction of circulation is due to the coriolis effect coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impact of a tropical cyclone compared to inland regions the primary energy source for these storms is warm ocean waters therefore these forms are typically strongest when over or near water and weaken quite rapidly over land coastal damage may be caused by strong winds and rain high waves due to winds storm surges due to severe pressure changes and the potential of spawning tornadoes tropical cyclones also draw in air from a large area—which can be a vast area for the most severe cyclones—and concentrate the precipitation of the water content in that air made up from atmospheric moisture and moisture evaporated from water into a much smaller area this continual replacement of moisture-bearing air by new moisture-bearing air after its moisture has fallen as rain may cause extremely heavy rain and river flooding up to 40 kilometres 25 mi from the coastline far beyond the amount of water that the local atmosphere holds at any one time though their effects on human populations are often devastating tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions they also carry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes which may play an important role in modulating regional

retired south pacific cyclone names outline of tropical cyclones tropical cyclones portal v t e physical structure see also eye cyclone diagram of a northern hemisphere hurricane tropical cyclones are areas of relatively low pressure in the troposphere with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface on earth the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level 7 the environment near the center of tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes thus they are characterized as warm core systems 8 wind field the near-surface wind field of a tropical cyclone is characterized by air rotating rapidly around a center of circulation while also flowing radially inwards at the outer edge of the storm air may be nearly calm however due to the earth s rotation the air has non-zero absolute angular momentum as air flows radially inward it begins to rotate cyclonically counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere in order to conserve angular momentum at an inner radius air begins to ascend to the top of the troposphere this radius is typically coincident with the inner radius of the eyewall and has the strongest near-surface winds of the storm consequently it is known as the radius of maximum winds 9 once aloft air flows away from the storm s center producing a shield of cirrus clouds 10 the previously mentioned processes result in a wind field that is nearly axisymmetric wind speeds are low at the center increase rapidly moving outwards to the radius of maximum winds and then decay more gradually with radius to large radii however the wind field often exhibits additional spatial and temporal variability due to the effects of localized processes such as thunderstorm activity and horizontal flow instabilities in the vertical direction winds are strongest near the surface and decay with height within the troposphere 11 eye and center play media nasa animation of hurricane arthur in 2014 showing rain rates and internal structure from gpm satellite data at the center of a mature tropical cyclone air sinks rather than rises for a sufficiently strong storm air may sink over a layer deep enough to suppress cloud formation thereby creating a clear eye weather in the eye is normally calm and free of clouds although the sea may be extremely violent 12 the eye is normally circular in shape and is typically 30–65 km 19–40 mi in diameter though eyes as small as 3 km 1.9 mi and as large as 370 km 230 mi have been observed 13 14 the cloudy outer edge of the eye is called the eyewall the eyewall typically expands outward with height resembling an arena football stadium this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the stadium effect 14 the eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found air rises most rapidly clouds reach to their highest altitude and precipitation is the heaviest the heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone s eyewall passes over land 12 in a weaker storm the eye may be obscured by the central dense overcast which is the upper-level cirrus shield that is associated with a concentrated area of strong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone 15 the eyewall may vary over time in the form of eyewall replacement cycles particularly in intense tropical cyclones outer rainbands can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum when the primary eyewall weakens the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily the outer eyewall eventually replaces the primary one at the end of the cycle at which time the storm may return to its original intensity 16 rapid deepening typhoon nabi as seen from the international space station on september 3 2005 main article rapid deepening on occasion tropical cyclones may undergo a process known as rapid deepening a period in which the minimum sea-level pressure of a tropical cyclone decreases by 42mb in a 24-hour period 17 in order for rapid deepening to occur several conditions must be in place water temperatures must be extremely high near or above 30 °c 86 °f and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not upwell cooler waters to the surface wind shear must be low when wind shear is high the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted usually an anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be present as well—for extremely low surface pressures to develop air must be rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently 18 size size descriptions of tropical cyclones roci type less than 2 degrees latitude very small midget 2 to 3 degrees of latitude small 3 to 6 degrees of latitude medium average 6 to 8 degrees of latitude large over 8 degrees of latitude very large 19 there are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size the most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind the radius of 34-knot wind i.e gale force the radius of outermost closed isobar roci and the radius of vanishing wind 20 21 an additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone s relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1 14 on earth tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes from 100–2,000 kilometres 62–1,243 mi as measured by the radius of vanishing wind they are largest on average in the northwest pacific ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern pacific ocean basin 22 if the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude 222 km 138 mi then the cyclone is very small or a midget a radius of 3–6 latitude degrees 333–670 km 207–416 mi is considered average sized very large tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees 888 km 552 mi 19 observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity i.e maximum wind speed radius of maximum wind latitude and maximum potential intensity 21 22 size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm all else equal a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time additionally a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch longer duration and enhanced wave setup 23 the upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere which at low latitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres 50,000–60,000 ft 24 physics and energetics tropical cyclones exhibit an overturning circulation where air inflows at low levels near the surface rises in thunderstorm clouds and outflows at high levels near the tropopause 25 the three-dimensional wind field in a tropical cyclone can be separated into two components a primary circulation and a secondary circulation the primary circulation is the rotational part of the flow it is purely circular the secondary circulation is the overturning in-up-out-down part of the flow it is in the radial and vertical directions the primary circulation is larger in magnitude dominating the surface wind field and is responsible for the majority of the damage a storm causes while the secondary circulation is slower but governs the energetics of the storm secondary circulation a carnot heat engine a tropical cyclone s primary energy source is heat from the evaporation of water from the ocean surface which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation the energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric carnot heat engine 26 first inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water i.e latent heat at the temperature of the warm ocean surface during evaporation the ocean cools and the air warms second the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content latent heat is simply converted to sensible heat during condensation third air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold tropopause finally air subsides and warms at the outer edge of the storm while conserving total heat content the first and third legs are nearly isothermal while the second and fourth legs are nearly isentropic this in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary circulation the carnot perspective provides an upper bound on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain scientists estimate that a tropical cyclone releases heat energy at the rate of 50 to 200 exajoules 1018 j per day 27 equivalent to about 1 pw 1015 watt this rate of energy release is equivalent to 70 times the world energy consumption of humans and 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity or to exploding a 10-megaton nuclear bomb every 20 minutes 27 28 primary circulation rotating winds the primary rotating flow in a tropical cyclone results from the conservation of angular momentum by the secondary circulation absolute angular momentum on a rotating planet m displaystyle m is given by m 1 2 f r 2 v r displaystyle m frac 1 2 fr 2 vr where f displaystyle f is the coriolis parameter v displaystyle v is the azimuthal i.e rotating wind speed and r displaystyle r is the radius to the axis of rotation the first term on the right hand side is the component of planetary angular momentum that projects onto the local vertical i.e the axis of rotation the second term on the right hand side is the relative angular momentum of the circulation itself with respect to the axis of rotation because the planetary angular momentum term vanishes at the equator where f 0 displaystyle f 0 tropical cyclones rarely form within 5° of the equator 5 29 as air flows radially inward at low levels it begins to rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum similarly as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the tropopause its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius resulting in an upper-level anti-cyclone the result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong cyclone at low levels and a strong anti-cyclone near the tropopause from thermal wind balance this corresponds to a system that is warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes i.e warm-core from hydrostatic balance the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface 11 maximum potential intensity due to surface friction the inflow only partially conserves angular momentum thus the sea surface lower boundary acts as both a source evaporation and sink friction of energy for the system this fact leads to the existence of a theoretical upper bound on the strongest wind speed that a tropical cyclone can attain because evaporation increases linearly with wind speed just as climbing out of a pool feels much colder on a windy day there is a positive feedback on energy input into the system known as the wind-induced surface heat exchange wishe feedback 26 this feedback is offset when frictional dissipation which increases with the cube of the wind speed becomes sufficiently large this upper bound is called the maximum potential intensity v p displaystyle v p and is given by v p 2 c k c d t s − t o t o Δ k displaystyle v p 2 frac c k c d frac t s t o t o delta k where t s displaystyle t s is the temperature of the sea surface t o displaystyle t o is the temperature of the outflow k Δ k displaystyle delta k is the enthalpy difference between the surface and the overlying air j kg and c k displaystyle c k and c d displaystyle c d are the surface exchange coefficients dimensionless of enthalpy and momentum respectively 30 the surface-air enthalpy difference is taken as Δ k k s ∗ − k displaystyle delta k k s k where k s ∗ displaystyle k s is the saturation enthalpy of air at sea surface temperature and sea-level pressure and k displaystyle k is the enthalpy of boundary layer air overlying the surface the maximum potential intensity is predominantly a function of the background environment alone i.e without a tropical cyclone and thus this quantity can be used to determine which regions on earth can support tropical cyclones of a given intensity and how these regions may evolve in time 31 32 specifically the maximum potential intensity has three components but its variability in space and time is due predominantly to the variability in the surface-air enthalpy difference component Δ k displaystyle delta k derivation a tropical cyclone may be viewed as a heat engine that converts input heat energy from the surface into mechanical energy that can be used to do mechanical work against surface friction at equilibrium the rate of net energy production in the system must equal the rate of energy loss due to frictional dissipation at the surface i.e w i n w o u t displaystyle w in w out the rate of energy loss per unit surface area from surface friction w o u t displaystyle w out is given by w o u t c d ρ u 3 displaystyle w out c d rho mathbf u 3 where ρ displaystyle rho is the density of near-surface air kg m3 and u displaystyle mathbf u is the near surface wind speed m s the rate of energy production per unit surface area w i n displaystyle w in is given by w i n ϵ q i n displaystyle w in epsilon q in where ϵ displaystyle epsilon is the heat engine efficiency and q i n displaystyle q in is the total rate of heat input into the system per unit surface area given that a tropical cyclone may be idealized as a carnot heat engine the carnot heat engine efficiency is given by ϵ t s − t o t s displaystyle epsilon frac t s t o t s heat enthalpy per unit mass is given by k c p t l v q displaystyle k c p t l v q where c p displaystyle c p is the heat capacity of air t displaystyle t is air temperature l v displaystyle l v is the latent heat of vaporization and q displaystyle q is the concentration of water vapor the first component corresponds to sensible heat and the second to latent heat there are two sources of heat input the dominant source is the input of heat at the surface primarily due to evaporation the bulk aerodynamic formula for the rate of heat input per unit area at the surface q i n k displaystyle q in k is given by q i n k c k ρ u Δ k displaystyle q in k c k rho mathbf u delta k where Δ k k s ∗ − k displaystyle delta k k s k represents the enthalpy difference between the ocean surface and the overlying air the second source is the internal sensible heat generated from frictional dissipation equal to w o u t displaystyle w out which occurs near the surface within the tropical cyclone and is recycled to the system q i n f r i c t i o n c d ρ u 3 displaystyle q in friction c d rho mathbf u 3 thus the total rate of net energy production per unit surface area is given by w i n t s − t o t s c k ρ u Δ k c d ρ u 3 displaystyle w in frac t s t o t s left c k rho mathbf u delta k c d rho mathbf u 3 right setting w i n w o u t displaystyle w in w out and taking u ≈ v displaystyle mathbf u approx v i.e the rotational wind speed is dominant leads to the solution for v p displaystyle v p given above this derivation assumes that total energy input and loss within the system can be approximated by their values at the radius of maximum wind the inclusion of q i n f r i c t i o n displaystyle q in friction acts to multiply the total heat input rate by the factor t s t o displaystyle frac t s t o mathematically this has the effect of replacing t s displaystyle t s with t o displaystyle t o in the denominator of the carnot efficiency an alternative definition for the maximum potential intensity which is mathematically equivalent to the above formulation is v p t s t o c k c d c a p e s ∗ − c a p e b m displaystyle v p sqrt frac t s t o frac c k c d cape s cape b m where cape stands for the convective available potential energy c a p e s ∗ displaystyle cape s is the cape of an air parcel lifted from saturation at sea level in reference to the environmental sounding c a p e b displaystyle cape b is the cape of the boundary layer air and both quantities are calculated at the radius of maximum wind 33 characteristic values and variability on earth on earth a characteristic temperature for t s displaystyle t s is 300 k and for t o displaystyle t o is 200 k corresponding to a carnot efficiency of ϵ 1 3 displaystyle epsilon 1 3 the ratio of the surface exchange coefficients c k c d displaystyle c k c d is typically taken to be 1 however observations suggest that the drag coefficient c d displaystyle c d varies with wind speed and may decrease at high wind speeds within the boundary layer of a mature hurricane 34 additionally c k displaystyle c k may vary at high wind speeds due to the effect of sea spray on evaporation within the boundary layer 35 a characteristic value of the maximum potential intensity v p displaystyle v p is 80 m s however this quantity varies significantly across space and time particularly within the seasonal cycle spanning a range of 0–100 m s 33 this variability is primarily due to variability in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium Δ k displaystyle delta k as well as in the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere which are controlled by the large-scale dynamics of the tropical climate these processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature and underlying ocean dynamics background near-surface wind speed and the vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating 36 the nature of this modulation is complex particularly on climate time-scales decades or longer on shorter time-scales variability in the maximum potential intensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical mean as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold water 37 however this relationship is indirect via the large-scale dynamics of the tropics the direct influence of the absolute sea surface temperature on v p displaystyle v p is weak in comparison interaction with the upper ocean chart displaying the drop in surface temperature in the gulf of mexico as hurricanes katrina and rita passed over the passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially which can influence subsequent cyclone development this cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters this effect results in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or lead to weakening additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from falling raindrops this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage all these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days 38 major basins and related warning centers

instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes the formation of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood 55 while six factors appear to be generally necessary tropical cyclones may occasionally form without meeting all of the following conditions in most situations water temperatures of at least 26.5 °c 79.7 °f are needed down to a depth of at least 50 m 160 ft 56 waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms 57 another factor is rapid cooling with height which allows the release of the heat of condensation that powers a tropical cyclone 56 high humidity is needed especially in the lower-to-mid troposphere when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop 56 low amounts of wind shear are needed as high shear is disruptive to the storm s circulation 56 tropical cyclones generally need to form more than 555 km 345 mi or five degrees of latitude away from the equator allowing the coriolis effect to deflect winds blowing towards the low pressure center and creating a circulation 56 lastly a formative tropical cyclone needs a preexisting system of disturbed weather tropical cyclones will not form spontaneously 56 low-latitude and low-level westerly wind bursts associated with the madden-julian oscillation can create favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis by initiating tropical disturbances 58 locations most tropical cyclones form in a worldwide band of thunderstorm activity near the equator referred to as the intertropical front itf the intertropical convergence zone itcz or the monsoon trough 59 60 61 another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves which contribute to the development of about 85 of intense tropical cyclones in the atlantic ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the eastern pacific 62 63 64 the majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the equator 65 and 87 forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south 66 67 because the coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5 degrees of the equator where the effect is weakest 66 however it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as tropical storm vamei and cyclone agni did in 2001 and 2004 respectively 68 69 movement the movement of a tropical cyclone i.e its track is typically approximated as the sum of two terms steering by the background environmental wind and beta drift 70 environmental steering environmental steering is the dominant term conceptually it represents the movement of the storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental conditions similar to leaves carried along by a stream 71 physically the winds or flow field in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as having two parts the flow associated with the storm itself and the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place in this way tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as advection of the storm by the local environmental flow this environmental flow is termed the steering flow climatologically tropical cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west trade winds on the equatorial side of the subtropical ridge—a persistent high-pressure area over the world s subtropical oceans 71 in the tropical north atlantic and northeast pacific oceans the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the african coast toward the caribbean sea north america and ultimately into the central pacific ocean before the waves dampen out 63 these waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region 62 in contrast in the indian ocean and western pacific in both hemispheres tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the inter-tropical convergence zone and the monsoon trough 72 additionally tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems such as extratropical cyclones beta drift in addition to environmental steering a tropical cyclone will tend to drift slowly poleward and westward a motion known as beta drift this motion is due to the superposition of a vortex such as a tropical cyclone onto an environment in which the coriolis force varies with latitude such as on a sphere or beta plane it is induced indirectly by the storm itself the result of a feedback between the cyclonic flow of the storm and its environment physically the cyclonic circulation of the storm advects environmental air poleward east of center and equatorial west of center because air must conserve its angular momentum this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre equatorward and westward of the storm center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward and eastward of the storm center the combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward this effect occurs even if there is zero environmental flow multiple storm interaction main article fujiwhara effect a third component of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves the interaction of multiple tropical cyclones when two cyclones approach one another their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems depending on their separation distance and strength the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge when the two vortices are of unequal size the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction and the smaller vortex will orbit around it this phenomenon is called the fujiwhara effect after sakuhei fujiwhara 73 interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies see also westerlies storm track of typhoon ioke showing recurvature off the japanese coast in 2006 though a tropical cyclone typically moves from east to west in the tropics its track may shift poleward and eastward either as it moves west of the subtropical ridge axis or else if it interacts with the mid-latitude flow such as the jet stream or an extratropical cyclone this motion termed recurvature commonly occurs near the western edge of the major ocean basins where the jet stream typically has a poleward component and extratropical cyclones are common 74 an example of tropical cyclone recurvature was typhoon ioke in 2006 75 landfall see also tropical cyclogenesis § unusual areas of formation the landfall of a tropical cyclone occurs when a storm s surface center moves over a coastline 9 storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and inland hours before landfall in fact a tropical cyclone can launch its strongest winds over land yet not make landfall noaa uses the term direct hit to describe when a location on the left side of the eye falls within the radius of maximum winds or twice that radius if on the right side whether or not the hurricane s eye made landfall 9 dissipation factors tropical storm franklin an example of a strongly sheared tropical cyclone in the north atlantic hurricane basin during 2005 a tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several different ways one such way is if it moves over land thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself quickly losing strength 76 most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure within a day or two or evolve into extratropical cyclones there is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water such as with hurricane ivan if it remains over mountains for even a short time weakening will accelerate 77 many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall 78 this rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides as was the case with hurricane mitch around honduras in october 1998 79 without warm surface water the storm cannot survive 80 a tropical cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below 26.5 °c 79.7 °f this will cause the storm to lose its tropical characteristics such as a warm core with thunderstorms near the center and become a remnant low-pressure area these remnant systems may persist for up to several days before losing their identity this dissipation mechanism is most common in the eastern north pacific 81 weakening or dissipation can occur if it experiences vertical wind shear causing the convection and heat engine to move away from the center this normally ceases development of a tropical cyclone 82 in addition its interaction with the main belt of the westerlies by means of merging with a nearby frontal zone can cause tropical cyclones to evolve into extratropical cyclones this transition can take 1–3 days 83 even after a tropical cyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated it can still have tropical storm force or occasionally hurricane typhoon force winds and drop several inches of rainfall in the pacific ocean and atlantic ocean such tropical-derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and may occasionally remain at hurricane or typhoon-force wind speeds when they reach the west coast of north america these phenomena can also affect europe where they are known as european windstorms hurricane iris s extratropical remnants are an example of such a windstorm from 1995 84 a cyclone can also merge with another area of low pressure becoming a larger area of low pressure this can strengthen the resultant system although it may no longer be a tropical cyclone 82 studies in the 2000s have given rise to the hypothesis that large amounts of dust reduce the strength of tropical cyclones 85 artificial dissipation in the 1960s and 1970s the united states government attempted to weaken hurricanes through project stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide it was thought that the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds 86 the winds of hurricane debbie—a hurricane seeded in project stormfury—dropped as much as 31 but debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays 87 in an earlier episode in 1947 disaster struck when a hurricane east of jacksonville florida promptly changed its course after being seeded and smashed into savannah georgia 88 because there was so much uncertainty about the behavior of these storms the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10 chance of making landfall within 48 hours greatly reducing the number of possible test storms the project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts today it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low 89 other approaches have been suggested over time including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans 90 other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation 91 dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop 90 or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons 92 project cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone 93 these approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived for any of the weakening techniques to be practical 94 effects the aftermath of hurricane katrina in gulfport mississippi main article effects of tropical cyclones tropical cyclones out at sea cause large waves heavy rain flood and high winds disrupting international shipping and at times causing shipwrecks 95 tropical cyclones stir up water leaving a cool wake behind them which causes the region to be less favorable for subsequent tropical cyclones 38 on land strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles buildings bridges and other outside objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles the storm surge or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90 of tropical cyclone deaths 96 the broad rotation of a landfalling tropical cyclone and vertical wind shear at its periphery spawns tornadoes tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices which persist until landfall 97 over the past two centuries tropical cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about 1.9 million people worldwide large areas of standing water caused by flooding lead to infection as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation 96 tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure leading to power outages bridge destruction and the hampering of reconstruction efforts 96 98 on average the gulf and east coasts of the united states suffer approximately us 5 billion 1995 us in cyclone damage every year the majority 83 of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes category 3 or greater however category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year 99 although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions 100 tropical cyclones also help maintain the global heat balance by moving warm moist tropical air to the middle latitudes and polar regions 101 and by regulating the thermohaline circulation through upwelling 102 the storm surge and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries which are typically important fish breeding locales tropical cyclone destruction spurs redevelopment greatly increasing local property values 103 when hurricanes surge upon shore from the ocean salt is introduced to many freshwater areas and raises the salinity levels too high for some habitats to withstand some are able to cope with the salt and recycle it back into the ocean but others can not release the extra surface water quickly enough or do not have a large enough freshwater source to replace it because of this some species of plants and vegetation die due to the excess salt 104 in addition hurricanes can carry toxins and acids onto shore when they make landfall the flood water can pick up the toxins from different spills and contaminate the land that it passes over the toxins are very harmful to the people and animals in the area as well as the environment around them the flooding water can also spark many dangerous oil spills 105 observation and forecasting observation main article tropical cyclone observation sunset view of hurricane isidore s rainbands photographed at 7,000 feet 2,100 m hurricane hunter wp-3d orion is used to go into the eye of a hurricane for data collection and measurements purposes intense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge as they are a dangerous oceanic phenomenon and weather stations being relatively sparse are rarely available on the site of the storm itself in general surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area or if there is a nearby ship real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated for this reason there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall 106 tropical cyclones far from land are tracked by weather satellites capturing visible and infrared images from space usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals as a storm approaches land it can be observed by land-based doppler weather radar radar plays a crucial role around landfall by showing a storm s location and intensity every several minutes 107 in situ measurements in real-time can be taken by sending specially equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone in the atlantic basin these flights are regularly flown by united states government hurricane hunters 108 the aircraft used are wc-130 hercules and wp-3d orions both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft these aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements the aircraft also launch gps dropsondes inside the cyclone these sondes measure temperature humidity pressure and especially winds between flight level and the ocean s surface a new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted aerosonde a small drone aircraft was flown through tropical storm ophelia as it passed virginia s eastern shore during the 2005 hurricane season a similar mission was also completed successfully in the western pacific ocean this demonstrated a new way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare 109 a general decrease in error trends in tropical cyclone path prediction is evident since the 1970s forecasting see also tropical cyclone track forecasting tropical cyclone prediction model and tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high and low-pressure areas and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system the deep layer mean flow or average wind through the depth of the troposphere is considered the best tool in determining track direction and speed if storms are significantly sheared use of wind speed measurements at a lower altitude such as at the 70 kpa pressure surface 3,000 metres or 9,800 feet above sea level will produce better predictions tropical forecasters also consider smoothing out short-term wobbles of the storm as it allows them to determine a more accurate long-term trajectory 110 high-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce computer models that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and strength of high and low-pressure systems combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones as well as with a wealth of data from earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades 111 however scientists are not as skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones 112 the lack of improvement in intensity forecasting is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development new tropical cyclone position and forecast information is available at least every twelve hours in the southern hemisphere and at least every six hours in the northern hemisphere from regional specialized meteorological centers and tropical cyclone warning centers 44 113 114 115 116 classifications terminology and naming intensity classifications main article tropical cyclone scales three tropical cyclones of the 2006 pacific typhoon season at different stages of development the weakest left demonstrates only the most basic circular shape a stronger storm top right demonstrates spiral banding and increased centralization while the strongest lower right has developed an eye tropical cyclones are classified into three main groups based on intensity tropical depressions tropical storms and a third group of more intense storms whose name depends on the region for example if a tropical storm in the northwestern pacific reaches hurricane-strength winds on the beaufort scale it is referred to as a typhoon if a tropical storm passes the same benchmark in the northeast pacific basin or in the north atlantic it is called a hurricane 9 neither hurricane nor typhoon is used in either the southern hemisphere or the indian ocean in these basins storms of a tropical nature are referred to as either tropical cyclones severe tropical cyclones or very intense tropical cyclones as indicated in the table below each basin uses a separate system of terminology which can make comparisons between different basins difficult in the pacific ocean hurricanes from the central north pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the northwest pacific becoming typhoons such as hurricane typhoon ioke in 2006 on rare occasions the reverse will occur 117 it should also be noted that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second m s over 150 miles per hour 240 km h are called super typhoons by the joint typhoon warning center 118 tropical depression tropical depression redirects here for the filipino reggae band see tropical depression band for the ep by elephant micah see tropical depression ep a tropical depression or tropical low is a tropical disturbance that has a clearly defined surface circulation with maximum sustained winds of less than 34 kn 39 mph 63 km h 43 within the southern hemisphere the depression can have gale force or stronger winds in one or more quadrants but not near the centre 43

sustained winds between 34 knots 63 km h and 64 knots 119 km h at this point the distinctive cyclonic shape starts to develop although an eye is not usually present government weather services first assign names to systems that reach this intensity thus the term named storm 119 although tropical storms are less intense than a hurricane they can produce significant damage the shear force of winds can blow off shingles and air borne objects can cause damage to power lines roofing and siding more dangerous is the heavy rainfall causing inland flooding 120 hurricane or typhoon main articles atlantic hurricane pacific hurricane and typhoon a hurricane or typhoon sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone as opposed to a depression or storm is a system with sustained winds of at

similar in hindustani and persian which in turn originates from greek typhon Τυφών a monster from greek mythology associated with storms 122 the related portuguese word tufão used in portuguese for typhoons is also derived from typhon 123 disputed for folk etymology   – discuss the word is also similar to chinese táifēng simplified chinese 台风 traditional chinese 颱風 fēng wind toifung in cantonese taifū 台風 in japanese and taepung 태풍 in korean the word hurricane used in the north atlantic and northeast pacific is derived from huracán the spanish word for the carib taino storm god juracán this god is believed by scholars to have been at least partially derived from the mayan creator god huracan huracan was believed by the maya to have created dry land out of the turbulent waters the god was also credited with later destroying the wooden people the precursors to the maize people with an immense storm and flood 124 125 huracan is also the source of the word orcan another word for a particularly strong european windstorm 125 naming main articles tropical cyclone naming and history of tropical cyclone naming the practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal start of naming 126 127 the system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems in a brief form that is readily understood and recognized by the public 126 127 the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907 126 127 this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of world war ii for the western pacific 126 127 formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the north and south atlantic eastern central western and southern pacific basins as well as the australian region and indian ocean 127 at present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven meteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts watches and warnings 126 since the systems can last a week or longer and more than one can be occurring in the same basin at the same time the names are thought to reduce the confusion about what storm is being described 126 names are assigned in order from predetermined lists with one three or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65 km h 40 mph depending on which basin it originates 39 41 42 however standards vary from basin to basin with some tropical depressions named in the western pacific while tropical cyclones have to have a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the center before they are named within the southern hemisphere 42 43 the names of significant tropical cyclones in the north atlantic ocean pacific ocean and australian region are retired from the naming lists and replaced with another name 39 40 43 notable tropical cyclones main articles list of notable tropical cyclones list of atlantic hurricanes and list of pacific hurricanes tropical cyclones that cause extreme destruction are rare although when they occur they can cause great amounts of damage or thousands of fatalities the 1970 bhola cyclone is the deadliest tropical cyclone on record killing more than 300,000 people 128 and potentially as many as 1 million 129 after striking the densely populated ganges delta region of bangladesh on november 13 1970 its powerful storm surge was responsible for the high death toll 128 the north indian cyclone basin has historically been the deadliest basin 96 130 elsewhere typhoon nina killed nearly 100,000 in china in 1975 due to a 100-year flood that caused 62 dams including the banqiao dam to fail 131 the great hurricane of 1780 is the deadliest north atlantic hurricane on record killing about 22,000 people in the lesser antilles 132 a tropical cyclone does not need to be particularly strong to cause memorable damage primarily if the deaths are from rainfall or mudslides tropical storm thelma in november 1991 killed thousands in the philippines 133 although the strongest typhoon to ever make landfall on record was typhoon haiyan on november 2013 causing widespread devastation in eastern visayas and killing at least 6,300 people in that country alone in 1982 the unnamed tropical depression that eventually became hurricane paul killed around 1,000 people in central america 134 hurricane katrina is estimated as the costliest tropical cyclone worldwide 135 causing 81.2 billion in property damage 2008 usd 136 with overall damage estimates exceeding 100 billion 2005 usd 135 katrina killed at least 1,836 people after striking louisiana and mississippi as a major hurricane in august 2005 136 hurricane sandy is the second most destructive tropical cyclone in u.s history with damage totaling 68 billion 2012 usd and with damage costs at 37.5 billion 2012 usd hurricane ike is the third most destructive tropical cyclone in u.s history the galveston hurricane of 1900 is the deadliest natural disaster in the united states killing an estimated 6,000 to 12,000 people in galveston texas 137 hurricane mitch caused more than 10,000 fatalities in central america making it the second deadliest atlantic hurricane in history hurricane iniki in 1992 was the most powerful storm to strike hawaii in recorded history hitting kauai as a category 4 hurricane killing six people and causing u.s 3 billion in damage 138 kauai was also struck by hurricanes dot 1959 and iwa 1982 see list of hawaii hurricanes other destructive eastern pacific hurricanes include pauline and kenna both causing severe damage after striking mexico as major hurricanes 139 140 in march 2004 cyclone gafilo struck northeastern madagascar as a powerful cyclone killing 74 affecting more than 200,000 and becoming the worst cyclone to affect the nation for more than 20 years 141 the relative sizes of typhoon tip cyclone tracy and the contiguous united states the most intense storm on record was typhoon tip in the northwestern pacific ocean in 1979 which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals 25.69 inhg and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165 knots 85 m s or 190 miles per hour 310 km h 142 the highest maximum sustained wind speed ever recorded was 185 knots 95 m s or 215 miles per hour 345 km h in hurricane patricia in 2015 which is the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the western hemisphere 143 typhoon nancy in 1961 also had recorded wind speeds of 185 knots 95 m s or 215 miles per hour 346 km h but recent research indicates that wind speeds from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high and this is no longer considered the storm with the highest wind speeds on record 121 likewise a surface-level gust caused by typhoon paka on guam in late 1997 was recorded at 205 knots 105 m s or 235 miles per hour 378 km h had it been confirmed it would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded on the earth s surface but the reading had to be discarded since the anemometer was damaged by the storm 144 the world meteorological organization established barrow island as the location of the highest non-tornado related wind gust at 408 km h 253 mph 145 the gust occurred on 10 april 1996 during severe tropical cyclone olivia and is documented in the australian meteorological and oceanographic journal 146 in addition to being the most intense tropical cyclone on record based on pressure tip was the largest cyclone on record with tropical storm-force winds 2,170 kilometres 1,350 mi in diameter the smallest storm on record tropical storm marco formed during october 2008 and made landfall in veracruz marco generated tropical storm-force winds only 37 kilometres 23 mi in diameter 147 hurricane john is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record lasting 31 days in 1994 before the advent of satellite imagery in 1961 however many tropical cyclones were underestimated in their durations 148 john is also the longest-tracked tropical cyclone in the northern hemisphere on record which had a path of 8,250 mi 13,280 km 149 cyclone rewa of the 1993–94 south pacific and australian region cyclone seasons had one of the longest tracks observed within the southern hemisphere traveling a distance of over 5,545 mi 8,920 km during december 1993 and january 1994 149 changes caused by el niño–southern oscillation see also el niño–southern oscillation most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the westerlies 150 when the subtropical ridge position shifts due to el niño so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks areas west of japan and korea tend to experience much fewer september–november tropical cyclone impacts during el niño and neutral years during el niño years the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°e which would favor the japanese archipelago 151 during el niño years guam s chance of a tropical cyclone impact is one-third more likely than of the long-term average 152 the tropical atlantic ocean experiences depressed activity due to increased vertical wind shear across the region during el niño years 153 during la niña years the formation of tropical cyclones along with the subtropical ridge position shifts westward across the western pacific ocean which increases the landfall threat to china and much greater intensity in the philippines 151 long-term activity trends see also atlantic hurricane reanalysis atlantic multidecadal cycle since 1950 using accumulated cyclone energy ace atlantic multidecadal oscillation timeseries 1856–2013 while the number of storms in the atlantic has increased since 1995 there is no obvious global trend the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87 ± 10 between 77 and 97 tropical cyclones annually however the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins primarily in the southern hemisphere 154 while noting that a significant downward trend in tropical cyclone numbers has been identified for the region near australia based on high quality data and accounting for the influence of the el niño-southern oscillation 155 in spite of that there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing kerry emanuel stated records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes the energy released by the average hurricane again considering all hurricanes worldwide seems to have increased by around 70 in the past 30 years or so corresponding to about a 15 increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60 increase in storm lifetime 156 atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially as evidenced by the fact that five of the ten most expensive storms in united states history have occurred since 1990 according to the world meteorological organization recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has been caused largely by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions 157 political scientist pielke et al 2008 normalized mainland us hurricane damage from 1900–2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage the 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades the decade 1996–2005 was the second most damaging among the past 11 decades with only the decade 1926–1935 surpassing its costs often in part because of the threat of hurricanes many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism therefore the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances the combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes therefore experts regard the early data as suspect 158 the number and strength of atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50–70 year cycle also known as the atlantic multidecadal oscillation nyberg et al reconstructed atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century and found five periods averaging 3–5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40–60 years and six other averaging 1.5–2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10–20 years these periods are associated with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation throughout a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1–2 per year 159 although more common since 1995 few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during 1970–94 160 destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960 including many major new england hurricanes twenty-one atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933 a record only recently exceeded in 2005 which saw 28 storms tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900–25 however many intense storms formed during 1870–99 during the 1887 season 19 tropical storms formed of which a record 4 occurred after november 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s however many struck in the early 19th century including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on new york city some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as category 4 in strength 161 these active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the atlantic basin before the satellite era began in 1960 tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one a ship reported a voyage through the storm or a storm hit land in a populated area 158 proxy records based on paleotempestological research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the gulf of mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia 162 163 few major hurricanes struck the gulf coast during 3000–1400 bc and again during the most recent millennium these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 bc and 1000 ad when the gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times this millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of the azores high 163 which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the north atlantic oscillation 164 according to the azores high hypothesis an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the gulf of mexico coast and the atlantic coast during the quiescent periods a more northeasterly position of the azores high would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the atlantic coast during the hyperactive period more hurricanes were steered towards the gulf coast as the azores high was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the caribbean such a displacement of the azores high is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in haiti around 3200 14c years bp 165 and a change towards more humid conditions in the great plains during the late-holocene as more moisture was pumped up the mississippi valley through the gulf coast preliminary data from the northern atlantic coast seem to support the azores high hypothesis a 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in cape cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500–1000 years just as the gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium climate change the 2012 ipcc report noted many observed changes in the climate including atmospheric composition global average temperatures ocean conditions and others the report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict in addition the report considered that it is likely that storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century and declared it more likely than not that there has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity 166 p.j webster and others published in 2005 an article in science examining the changes in tropical cyclone number duration and intensity over the past 35 years the period when satellite data has been available their main finding was although the number of cyclones decreased throughout the planet excluding the north atlantic ocean there was a great increase in the number and proportion of very strong cyclones 167 according to 2006 studies by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the earth s climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 168 studies published since 2008 by kerry emanuel from mit indicate that global warming is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of hurricane and cyclone activity 169 in an article in nature kerry emanuel stated that potential hurricane destructiveness a measure combining hurricane strength duration and frequency is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature reflecting well-documented climate signals including multidecadal oscillations in the north atlantic and north pacific and global warming emanuel predicted a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century 170 research reported in the september 3 2008 issue of nature found that the strongest tropical cyclones are getting stronger in particular over the north atlantic and indian oceans wind speeds for the strongest tropical storms increased from an average of 225 km h 140 mph in 1981 to 251 km h 156 mph in 2006 while the ocean temperature averaged globally over all the regions where tropical cyclones form increased from 28.2 °c 82.8 °f to 28.5 °c 83.3 °f during this period 171 172 a 2017 study looked at compounding effects from floods storm surge and terrestrial flooding rivers and projects an increase due to global warming 173 174 related cyclone types gustav on september 9 2002 the first system to be given a name as a subtropical cyclone see also cyclone extratropical cyclone and subtropical cyclone in addition to tropical cyclones there are two other classes of cyclones within the spectrum of cyclone types these kinds of cyclones known as extratropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones can be stages a tropical cyclone passes through during its formation or dissipation 175 an extratropical cyclone is a storm that derives energy from horizontal temperature differences which are typical in higher latitudes a tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses although not as frequently an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm and from there into a tropical cyclone 176 from space extratropical storms have a characteristic comma-shaped cloud pattern 177 extratropical cyclones can also be dangerous when their low-pressure centers cause powerful winds and high seas 178 a subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone they can form in a wide band of latitudes from the equator to 50° although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm 179 from an operational standpoint a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition 180 popular culture main article tropical cyclones in popular culture in popular culture tropical cyclones have made several appearances in different types of media including films books television music and electronic games 181 these media often portray tropical cyclones that are either entirely fictional or based on real events 181 for example george rippey stewart s storm a best-seller published in 1941 is thought to have influenced meteorologists on their decision to assign female names to pacific tropical cyclones 127 another example is the hurricane in the perfect storm which describes the sinking of the andrea gail by the 1991 perfect storm 182 hypothetical hurricanes have been featured in parts of the plots of series such as the simpsons invasion family guy seinfeld dawson s creek burn notice and csi miami 181 183 184 185 186 187 the 2004 film the day after tomorrow includes several mentions of actual

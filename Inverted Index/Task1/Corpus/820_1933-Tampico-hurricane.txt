category 5 intensity on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale nb 1 it developed on september 16 near the lesser antilles and slowly intensified while moving across the caribbean sea becoming a hurricane on september 19 its strengthening rate increased while passing south of jamaica two days later the hurricane reached peak winds estimated at 160 mph 260 km h after weakening it made landfall on the yucatán peninsula destroying several houses one person was killed offshore progreso yucatán during the storm over land the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm although it re-intensified slightly in the gulf of mexico on september 25 it made a second landfall just south of tampico tamaulipas with winds at around 110 mph 180 km h and it quickly dissipated over land damage was heaviest there estimated at 5 million 1933 usd and there were hundreds of deaths about 75 of the houses in tampico were damaged including about 50 of houses that had severe to total destruction to their roofs the destruction prompted the declaration of martial law and there was a curfew instated meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical disturbance moved westward across the tropical atlantic ocean in mid-september on september 16 it was estimated that a tropical depression developed about 185 mi 300 km east-northeast of tobago it moved west-northwestward through the lesser antilles passing about 14 mi 22 km south of grenada however the system was very weak and the island reported east winds of only 12 mph 19 km h after entering the caribbean sea the depression intensified into a tropical storm on september 18 and a day later it became a hurricane on september 20 it passed to the south of jamaica while quickly strengthening at 0000 utc on september 21 a ship in the eye reported a barometric pressure of 929 mbar 27.4 inhg ordinarily the pressure reading would suggest winds of 153 mph 246 km h however observations from the ship indicated the hurricane was smaller than normal with a radius of maximum winds of 8 mi 13 km as a result the peak winds were estimated at 160 mph 260 km h or a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale 3 after peaking in intensity the hurricane continued to the northwest early on september 22 it passed about 50 mi 80 km nb 2 south of cozumel before making landfall on the yucatán peninsula 3 4 its landfall intensity was unknown the atlantic hurricane reanalysis in 2012 suggested that the storm could have retained category 5 status until landfall although local observations did not validate the theory in the original analysis of the season the landfall intensity was estimated at 105 mph 165 km h as a compromise the 2012 reanalysis estimated the hurricane struck land with winds of 140 mph 230 km h the cyclone rapidly weakened while crossing the yucatán peninsula and on september 23 it emerged into the gulf of mexico with winds of 65 mph 105 km h it quickly reintensified into a hurricane while moving toward the northeast mexican coastline at around 0000 utc on september 25 the hurricane made its final landfall just south of tampico tamaulipas with winds of 110 mph 180 km h this was based on a ship in the eye reporting a pressure of 960 mbar 28 inhg within 12 hours the storm dissipated over land 3 impact edit while passing south of jamaica

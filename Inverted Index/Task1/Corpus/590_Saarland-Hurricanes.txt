before another division title in 2010 meant direct promotion back to the gfl courtesy to a league expansion 2 the club was only able to win two of their regular season games in 2011 and finished second-last in the gfl south avoiding relegation because of an even worse performance by the plattling black hawks 3 in 2012 the club came seventh in the southern division of the gfl and thereby failed to qualify for the play-off it improved to fifth place in 2013 but again did not qualify for the play-offs the 2014 season saw another sixth-place finish and the club once again missed out on

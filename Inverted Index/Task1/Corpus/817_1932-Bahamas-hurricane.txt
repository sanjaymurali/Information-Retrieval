1933 and 1992 3 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the system was first detected just to the north of the virgin islands as a tropical depression late on august 30 3 the storm moved generally west-northwest passing to the north of the greater antilles and grand turk on the night of september 2–3 it reached minimal hurricane intensity as it passed near the turks and caicos islands and began a period of rapid strengthening shortly thereafter 2 it became a major hurricane early on september 4 and reached

260 km h at this time maintaining strength the storm passed over great abaco on september 5 and gradually began to curve northeast away from the mainland united states it continued northeast while weakening in intensity delivering sea swells to the northeastern united states and winds of 56 mph 90 km h to nantucket as the storm bypassed new england the storm became extratropical on september 9 crossed south of the avalon peninsula newfoundland and labrador on september 11 and eventually passed near the snæfellsnes iceland and jan mayen island it dissipated on september 17 3 preparations

although the cyclone passed within 65 mi 105 km of the bahamian capital nassau the storm only caused winds up to 50 mph 80 km h and no significant damage there 9 the storm was very destructive on abaco island where the reported barometric pressure was below 27.50 inhg 931.3 mb at hope town strong winds shifting from northeast to southeast destroyed 83 homes and severely damaged 63 food supplies ran low and salt contaminated the drinking supply all public buildings along with the radio station were destroyed the lowest pressure at hope town was 27.20 inhg 921.1 mb around 15 utc on

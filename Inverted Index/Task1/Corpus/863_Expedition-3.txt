when their custom soyuz seat-liners were transferred to space shuttle endeavour for the return trip home during mission sts-108 the expedition three crew of the international space station enjoyed a unique view of the 2001 leonid meteor storm it looked like we were seeing ufos approaching the earth flying in formation three or four at a time recalls astronaut frank culbertson there were hundreds per minute going beneath us really spectacular news reports had warned sky watchers in advance on 18 november 2001 earth was due to plow through a minefield of debris shed by comet tempel-tuttle innumerable bits of comet dust would become meteors when they hit earth s atmosphere at 144,000 miles per hour 64,000 m s experts predicted an unforgettable display . and it came millions of people saw the show but only three of them—the ones on board the space station—saw it from above we had to look down to see the meteors says culbertson that s because the atmosphere where comet dust burns up is below the station an international crew of three were the third crew to live aboard the international space station the team was led by american commander frank culbertson and joined by russian crewmates vladimir dezhurov mission pilot and flight engineer mikhail tyurin as a part of the sts-105 mission discovery delivered the expedition 3 crew to the station during their four-month stay the crew saw the orbital complex expand and research work grow the expedition 3 crew returned home on mission sts-108 spacewalks edit all four of the spacewalks during expedition 3 were completed using

crane s boom to simulate a cargo they also inspected and photographed a small panel of one solar array on the zvezda service module that has one portion of a panel not fully unfolded 2 3 expedition 3

routes and locations of the periplus of the erythraean sea these routes usually began in the far east or down river from madhya pradesh with transshipment via historic bharuch bharakuccha traversed past the inhospitable coast of today s iran then split around hadhramaut into two streams north into the gulf of aden and thence into the levant or south into alexandria via red sea ports such as axum each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravan travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiates this southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern arabian peninsula yemen and oman today was significant and the egyptian pharaohs built several shallow canals to service the trade one more or less along the route of today s

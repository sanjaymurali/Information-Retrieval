seasons hurricane diana was the deadliest tropical cyclone during the 1990 atlantic hurricane season killing 139 people in mexico forming out of a tropical wave on august 4 the system brushed honduras before intensifying into a tropical storm the following day gradually gaining strength diana struck the yucatán peninsula with winds of 65 mph 100 km h due land interaction the cyclone weakened slightly before moving over the warm waters of the bay of campeche on august 6 once over water the diana quickly became a hurricane and later reached its peak intensity on august 7 as a category 2 on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale shortly thereafter the storm made landfall near tampico tamaulipas with winds of 100 mph 165 km h rapid weakening ensued once the storm moved over the high terrain of mexico and diana diminished to a tropical depression roughly 24 hours after moving onshore the cyclone later emerged into the gulf of california on august 9 before dissipating though its remnants were monitored until august 14 when the system lost its identity over arizona throughout mexico hurricane diana produced torrential rains that triggered deadly flooding and landslides roughly 155 mi² 400 km² of farmland was destroyed and 30,000 people were left homeless by the storm numerous roads and railways were either washed out or blocked by debris cutting communication with several communities in all 139 people were killed in the country and 90 million 1990 usd was wrought in damage due to the extensive loss of life and damage caused by the storm the name diana was retired the following year and replaced with dolly which was first used in the 1996 season meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the origins of hurricane diana were from a tropical wave that existed western africa into the atlantic on july 27 conditions were unfavorable for development of a tropical cyclone and the tropical wave remained disorganized until reaching the eastern caribbean sea the system entered the caribbean sea through the southern windward islands where falling barometric pressures were observed decreasing by 3.5 mbar hpa 0.1 inhg in 24 hours upper-level air data from the lesser antilles indicated that the tropical wave was associated with an upper-level anticyclone with increasing convection the first air force reconnaissance plane flight indicated no low-level circulation but a relatively large amount of thunderstorm activity the system continued to have a large amount of associated convection while passing over the netherlands antilles as indicated by satellite images and surface observations cyclonic rotation was observed in the low-level convection by satellite images and the fifth tropical depression of the season had developed at 0000 utc on august 4 situated in the southwestern caribbean sea however this was based on surface observations and it was not confirmed that tropical cyclone formation occurred until later that day 1 the new tropical depression moved to the northwest under the influence of a mid-level trough and rapidly intensified to a tropical storm the following day offshore of eastern honduras the national hurricane center assigned the name diana to the system becoming a tropical storm diana further intensified and winds reached 65 mph 105 km h before landfall in felipe carrillo puerto in quintana roo occurred the storm initially rapidly weakened over land although it retained winds of 50 mph 80 km h until moving over open waters when diana entered the southern gulf of mexico the trough of low pressure in that vicinity weakened and steering currents caused the storm to head westward conditions became more favorable in the gulf of mexico and diana quickly intensified becoming a hurricane late on august 7 hurricane diana rapidly intensified and briefly reached category 2 hurricane status attaining peak intensity with winds of 100 mph 165 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 980 mbar hpa 28.94 inhg only two hours after attaining peak intensity on august 7 hurricane diana made landfall near tampico tamaulipas at the same intensity 1 moving inland diana rapidly weakened over the high terrain of mexico quickly deteriorating from a low-end category 2 hurricane to a strong tropical storm within four hours diana continued westward over mexico and weakened to a tropical depression on august 8 while centered near mexico city the weakening tropical depression turned west-northwestward over central mexico and emerged into the pacific ocean on august 9 before dissipating in the gulf of california 1 the remnants of hurricane diana curved northward and tracked through the gulf of california and eventually came ashore in northwestern sonora crossing northwestern mexico the remnants of diana entered arizona and quickly dissipated 2 preparations edit see also tropical cyclone warnings and watches § north atlantic systems in anticipation of diana s first landfall a tropical storm warning was issued on august 5 for cancún mexico southward to belize city belize on august 5 including the offshore islands from both nations a tropical storm warning indicates that tropical storm force winds 39 to 73 mph 39 to 118 km h are expected within 24 hours eleven hours later the tropical storm warning was extended as far as carmen but was discontinued for the entire east coast of belize 3 residents along coastal areas of quintana roo were advised to evacuate inland 4 as tides were expected to range from 3 to 5 ft 0.91 to 1.52 m above normal 5 emergency officials set up shelters were set up in xcalak punta herrero and punta allen 4 the mexican coast guard was placed on alert and shipping across quantana roo was suspended during the evening of august 5 additionally there were concerns about flash flooding due to the possibility of 5 to 8 in 130 to 200 mm of rainfall in areas near the storm s path 5 after diana made landfall on the yucatán peninsula on august 6 all of the tropical storm warnings in place were discontinued 3 diana then threatened the mainland east coast of mexico a hurricane watch was issued for tuxpan to boca de jesus maria at 21 00 utc on august 6 a hurricane watch notes the possibility of hurricane conditions within 48 hours such as winds of at least 74 mph 119 km h early on august 7 the national hurricane center anticipated hurricane conditions within 24 hours and as a result a hurricane warning was issued for nautla to le pesca simultaneously a tropical storm warning was issued for la pesca to boca de jesus maria later that day a hurricane warning had been issued for a similar area stretching from nautla to lerdo de tejada 3 the national hurricane center also predicted precipitation totals of 8 in 200 mm and emphasized that flash floods and mudslides would likely occurred in the vicinity of where diana was projected to make landfall 6 according to miguelangel rebolledo the captain of the port of tuxpan about 300 people fled low-lying areas 7 state and federal officials prepared 10,000 packages of emergency supplies food and medicine and moved

the five great lakes of north america it is surrounded on the north west and southwest by the canadian province of ontario and on the south and east by the american state of new york whose water boundaries meet in the middle of the lake ontario canada s most populous province was named for the lake in the huron language the name ontarí io means lake of shining waters its primary inlet is the niagara river from lake erie the last in the great lakes chain lake ontario serves as the outlet to the atlantic ocean via the saint lawrence river geography edit lake ontario basin view from fort

feet 802 ft 244 m 2 3 the lake s primary source is the niagara river draining lake erie with the st lawrence river serving as the outlet the drainage basin covers 24,720 square miles 64,030 km2 1 5 as with all the great lakes water levels change both within the year owing to seasonal changes in water input and among years owing to longer term trends in precipitation these water level fluctuations are an integral part of lake ecology and produce and maintain extensive wetlands 6 7 the lake also has an important freshwater fishery although it has been negatively affected by factors including over-fishing water pollution and invasive species 8 baymouth bars built by prevailing winds and currents have created a significant number of lagoons and sheltered harbors mostly near but not limited to prince edward county ontario and the easternmost shores perhaps the best-known example is toronto bay chosen as the site of the upper canada ontario capital for its strategic harbour other prominent examples include hamilton harbour irondequoit bay presqu ile bay and sodus bay the bars themselves are the sites of long beaches such as sandbanks provincial park and sandy island beach state park these sand bars are often associated with large wetlands which support large numbers of plant and animal species as well as providing important rest areas for migratory birds 9 10 presqu ile on the north shore of lake ontario is particularly significant in this regard one unique feature of the lake is the z-shaped bay of quinte which separates prince edward county from the ontario mainland save for a 2-mile 3.2 km isthmus near trenton this feature also supports many wetlands and aquatic plants as well as associated fisheries major rivers draining into lake ontario include the niagara river don river humber river trent river cataraqui river genesee river oswego river black river little salmon river and the salmon river geology edit lake ontario bathymetric map 11 12 13 the deepest point is marked with × 14 the lake basin was carved out of soft weak silurian-age rocks by the wisconsin ice sheet during the last ice age the action of the ice occurred along the pre-glacial ontarian river valley which had approximately the same orientation as today s basin material that was pushed southward by the ice sheet left landforms such as drumlins kames and moraines both on the modern land surface and the lake bottom 15 reorganizing the region s entire drainage system as the ice sheet retreated toward the north it still dammed the st lawrence valley outlet so that the lake surface was at a higher level this stage is known as lake iroquois during that time the lake drained through present-day syracuse new york into the mohawk river thence to the hudson river and the atlantic the shoreline created during this stage can be easily recognized by the now dry beaches and wave-cut hills 10 to 25 miles 15 to 40 km from the present shoreline when the ice finally receded from the st lawrence valley the outlet was below sea level and for a short time the lake became a bay of the atlantic ocean in association with the champlain sea gradually the land rebounded from the release of the weight of about 6,500 feet 2,000 m of ice that had been stacked on it it is still rebounding about 12 inches 30 cm per century in the st lawrence area since the ice receded from the area last the most rapid rebound still occurs there this means that the lake bed is gradually tilting southward inundating the south shore and turning river valleys into bays both north and south shores experience shoreline erosion but the tilting amplifies this effect on the south shore causing loss to property owners history edit map of lac de frontenac now lake ontario showing teiaiagon and lac taronto now lake simcoe the name ontario is derived from the huron word ontarí io which means great lake the lake was a border between the huron people and the iroquois confederacy in the pre-columbian era in the 1600s the iroquois drove out the huron from southern ontario and settled the northern shores of lake ontario when the iroquois withdrew and the anishnabeg ojibwa mississaugas moved in from the north to southern ontario they retained the iroquois name 16 it is believed that the first european to reach the lake was Étienne brûlé in 1615 as was their practice the french explorers introduced other names for the lake in 1632 and 1656 the lake was referred to as lac de st louis or lake st louis by samuel de champlain and cartographer nicolas sanson respectively likely for louis xiv of france 17 in 1660 jesuit historian francis creuxius coined the name lacus ontarius in a map drawn in the relation des jésuites 1662–1663 the lake bears the legend lac ontario ou des iroquois with the name ondiara in smaller type a french map produced in 1712 currently in the canadian museum of history 18 created by military engineer jean-baptiste de couagne identified lake ontario as lac frontenac named after louis de buade comte de frontenac et de palluau he was a french soldier courtier and governor general of new france from 1672 to 1682 and from 1689 to his death in 1698 artifacts which are believed to be of norse origin have been found in the area of sodus bay indicating the possibility of trading by the indigenous peoples with norse explorers on the east coast of north america 19 a series of trading posts were established by both the british and french such as fort frontenac kingston in 1673 fort oswego in 1722 fort rouillé toronto in 1750 after the french and indian war all forts around the lake were under british control the united states did not take possession of forts on present-day american territory until the signing of the jay treaty in 1794 permanent non-military european settlement began during the american revolution as the easternmost and nearest lake to the atlantic seaboard of canada and the united states population centres here are among the oldest in the great lakes basin with kingston ontario formerly the capital of canada dating to the 1670s fort frontenac the lake became a hub of commercial activity following the war of 1812 with canal building on both sides of the border and heavy travel by lake steamers steamer activity peaked in the mid-19th century before competition from railway lines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries a type of scow known as a stone hooker was in operation on the north-west shore particularly around port credit and bronte stonehooking was the practice of raking flat fragments of dundas shale from the shallow lake floor of the area for use in construction particularly in the growing city of toronto 20 ecology and environmental concerns edit wetlands on a lakeshore the great lakes watershed is a region of high biodiversity and lake ontario is important for its diversity of birds fish reptiles amphibians and plants many of these special species are associated with shorelines particularly sand dunes lagoons and wetlands the importance of wetlands to the lake has been appreciated and many of the larger wetlands have protected status however these wetlands are changing in part because the natural water level fluctuations have been reduced many wetland plants are dependent upon low water levels to reproduce 21 when water levels are stabilized the area and diversity of the marsh is reduced this is particularly true of meadow marsh also known as wet meadow wetlands for example in eel bay near alexandria bay regulation of lake levels has resulted in large losses of wet meadow 22 often this is accompanied by the invasion of cattails which displace many of the native plant species and reduce plant diversity eutrophication may accelerate this process by providing nitrogen and phosphorus for the more rapid growth of competitively dominant plants 23 similar effects are occurring on the north shore in wetlands such as presqu ile which have interdunal wetlands called pannes with high plant diversity and many unusual plant species 24 most of the forests around the lake are deciduous forests dominated by trees including maple oak beech ash and basswood these are classified as part of the mixedwood plains ecozone by environment canada or as the eastern great lakes and hudson lowlands by the united states environmental protection agency or as the great lakes ecoregion by the nature conservancy 25 deforestation in the vicinity of the lake has had many negative impacts 26 including loss of forest birds extinction of native salmon and increased amounts of sediment flowing into the lake in some areas more than 90 percent of the forest cover has been removed and replaced by agriculture certain tree species such as hemlock have also been particularly depleted by past logging activity 27 guidelines for restoration stress the importance of maintaining and restoring forest cover particularly along streams and wetlands 28 29 the open water is less-affected by shoreline features such as wetlands and more affected by nutrient levels that control the production of algae algae are the basis of the open water food web and the source of primary production that ends up as lake trout and walleye at the top of the open water food web lake sturgeon were abundant in 1860 and had been driven to near extinction by 1960 like the other great lakes lake ontario used to have an important commercial fishery it has been largely destroyed mostly by over-fishing consider the lake sturgeon as but one example lake sturgeon are huge fish—they can grow up to three meters long and exceed 190 kg in weight the females mature slowly and require decades to reach sexual maturity it was once an abundant species in lake ontario in 1860 this species taken on incidental catches of other fishes was killed and dumped back in the lake piled up on shore to dry and be burned fed to pigs or dug into the earth as fertilizer 30 it was even stacked like cordwood and used to fuel steamboats once its value was realized they were taken by every available means from spearing and jigging to set lines of baited or unbaited hooks laid on the bottom to trapnets poundnets and gillnets 30 over 5 million pounds were taken from adjoining lake erie in a single year the fishery collapsed largely by 1900 they have never recovered like most sturgeons the lake sturgeon is rare now and is protected in many areas populations in the oswego river are being actively managed for recovery lake ontario food web this food web has been damaged not only by over-fishing and changes in nutrient levels but also by other types of pollution from industrial chemicals agricultural fertilizers untreated sewage phosphates from laundry detergents and pesticides some pollutant chemicals that have been found in the lake include ddt benzo a pyrene and other pesticides pcbs aramite chromium lead mirex mercury and carbon tetrachloride the international joint commission has identified areas where pollution is particularly intense point sources and mapped them as areas of concern a remedial action plan has been developed for each area some lake ontario areas of concern include the oswego river and rochester embayment on the american side and hamilton harbour and toronto on the canadian side citation needed by the 1960s and 1970s the increased pollution caused frequent algal blooms to occur in the summer 8 these blooms killed large numbers of fish and left decomposing piles of filamentous algae and dead fish along the shores 31 at times the blooms became so thick that waves could not break fish eating birds such as osprey bald eagle and cormorant were being poisoned by contaminated fish since the 1960s and 1970s environmental concerns have forced a cleanup of industrial and municipal wastes cleanup has been accomplished through better treatment plants tighter environmental regulations deindustrialization and increased public awareness today lake ontario has recovered some of its pristine quality for example walleye a fish species considered as a marker of clean water are now found however regional airshed pollution remains a concern the lake has also become an important sport fishery although with introduced species coho and chinook salmon rather than the native species bald eagle and osprey populations are also beginning to recover invasive species are a problem for lake ontario particularly lamprey and zebra mussels lamprey are being controlled by poisoning in the juvenile stage in the streams where they breed zebra mussels in particular are difficult to control and pose major challenges for the lake and its waterways climate edit the lake has a natural seiche rhythm of eleven minutes the seiche effect normally is only about  3⁄4 inches 2 cm but can be greatly amplified by earth movement winds and atmospheric pressure changes because of its great depth the lake as a whole never freezes in winter but an ice sheet covering between 10 and 90 of the lake area typically develops depending on the severity of the winter ice sheets typically form along the shoreline and in slack water bays where the lake is not as deep during the winters of 1877 and 1878 the ice sheet coverage was up to 95–100 in most of the lake in the winter of 1812 the ice cover was stable enough that the american naval commander stationed at sackets harbor feared a british attack from kingston over the ice when the cold winds of winter pass over the warmer water of the lake they pick up moisture and drop it as lake-effect snow since the prevailing winter winds are from the northwest the southern and southeastern shoreline of the lake is referred to as the snowbelt in some winters the area between oswego and pulaski may receive twenty or more feet 600 cm of snowfall also impacted by lake-effect snow is the tug hill plateau an area of elevated land that is about 20 miles 32 km east of lake ontario creating ideal conditions for lake-effect snowfall the hill as it is often referred to typically receives more snow than any other region in the eastern united states as a result tug hill is a popular location for winter enthusiasts such as snow-mobilers and cross-country skiers lake-effect snow often extends inland as far as syracuse with that city often recording the most winter snowfall accumulation of any large city in the united states other cities in the world receive more snow annually such as quebec city which averages 135 inches 340 cm and sapporo japan which receives 250 inches 640 cm each year and is often regarded as the snowiest city in the world foggy conditions particularly in fall can be created by thermal contrasts and can be an impediment for recreational boaters in a normal winter lake ontario will be at most one quarter ice-covered in a mild winter almost completely unfrozen lake ontario has completely frozen over on five recorded occasions from about january 20 to about march 20 1830 32 in 1874 33 in 1893 33 in 1912 33 and in february 1934 33 lake breezes in spring tend to retard fruit bloom until the frost danger is past and in the autumn delay the onset of fall frost particularly on the south shore cool onshore winds also retard early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season protecting them from possible frost damage such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area apples cherries pears plums and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around rochester between stoney creek and niagara-on-the-lake on the niagara peninsula is a major fruit-growing and wine-making area the wine-growing region extends over the international border into niagara and orleans counties apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lake s north shore around cobourg settlements edit winter scene on toronto

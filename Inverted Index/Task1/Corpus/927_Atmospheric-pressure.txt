newton navier stokes v t e atmospheric pressure sometimes also called barometric pressure is the pressure within the atmosphere of earth or that of another planet in most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point as elevation increases there is less overlying atmospheric mass so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation pressure measures force per unit area with si units of pascals 1 pa 1 n m2 on average a column of air one square centimetre cm2 0.16 sq in in cross-section measured from sea level to the top of the earth s atmosphere has a mass of about 1.03 kilograms 2.3 lb and weight of about 10.1 newtons 2.3 lbf that weight across one square centimeter is a pressure

pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface and is a function of the mass of the planet the radius of the surface and the amount of gas and its vertical distribution in the atmosphere citation needed it is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity density variations due to temperature and variations in

given in weather reports on radio television and newspapers or on the internet when barometers in the home are set to match the local weather reports they measure pressure adjusted to sea level not the actual local atmospheric pressure the altimeter setting in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment average sea-level pressure is 1013.25 mbar 101.325 kpa 29.921 inhg 760.00 mmhg in aviation

atmospheric pressure records altitude variation edit a very local storm above snæfellsjökull showing clouds formed on the mountain by orographic lift variation in atmospheric pressure with altitude computed for 15 °c and 0 relative humidity this plastic bottle was sealed at approximately 14,000 feet 4,300 m altitude and was crushed by the increase in atmospheric pressure —at 9,000 feet 2,700 m and 1,000 feet 300 m — as it was brought down towards sea level pressure varies smoothly from the earth s surface to the top of the mesosphere although the pressure changes with the weather nasa has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round as altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases one can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude 4 temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure and it is necessary to know these to compute an accurate figure the graph at right was developed for a temperature of 15 °c and a relative humidity of 0 at low altitudes above sea level the pressure decreases by about 1.2 kpa for every 100 metres for higher altitudes within the troposphere the following equation the barometric formula relates

climate see pressure system for the effects of air pressure variations on weather atmospheric pressure shows a diurnal or semidiurnal twice-daily cycle caused by global atmospheric tides this effect is strongest in tropical zones with an amplitude of a few millibars and almost zero in polar areas these variations have two superimposed cycles a circadian 24 h cycle and semi-circadian 12 h cycle records edit the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on earth above 750 meters was 1085.7 hpa 32.06 inhg measured in tosontsengel mongolia on 19 december 2001 5 the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded below 750 meters was at agata in evenk autonomous okrug russia 66°53’n 93°28’e elevation 261 m 856 ft on 31 december 1968 of 1083.8 hpa 32.005 inhg 6 the discrimination is due to the problematic assumptions assuming a standard lapse rate associated with reduction of sea level from high elevations 5 the dead sea the lowest place on earth at 430 metres 1,410 ft below sea level has a correspondingly high typical atmospheric pressure of 1065 hpa 7 the lowest non-tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was 870 hpa 0.858 atm 25.69 inhg set on 12 october 1979 during typhoon tip in the western pacific ocean the measurement was based on an instrumental observation made from a reconnaissance aircraft 8 measurement based on depth of water edit one atmosphere 101 kpa or 14.7 psi is also the pressure caused by the weight of a column of fresh water of approximately 10.3 m 33.8 ft thus a diver 10.3 m underwater experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres 1 atm of air plus 1 atm of water conversely 10.3 m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using suction under standard atmospheric conditions low pressures such as natural gas lines are sometimes specified in inches of water typically written as w.c water column or w.g inches water gauge a typical gas-using residential appliance in the us is rated for a maximum of 14 w.c. which is approximately 35 hpa similar metric units with a wide variety of names and notation based on millimetres centimetres or metres are now less commonly used boiling point of water edit boiling water pure water boils at 100 °c 212 °f at earth s standard atmospheric pressure the boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the water 9 because of this the boiling point of water is lower at lower pressure and higher at higher pressure cooking at high elevations therefore requires adjustments to recipes 10 a rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils in the mid-19th century this method was used by explorers 11 measurement and maps edit an important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains thanks to the availability of reliable pressure measurement devices while in 1774 maskelyne was confirming newton s theory of gravitation at and on schiehallion in scotland using plumb bob deviation to show the effect of gravity and accurately measure elevation william roy using barometric pressure was able to confirm his height determinations the agreement being to within one meter 3.28 feet this was then a useful tool for survey work and map making and long has continued to be useful it was part of the application of science which gave practical people the insight that applied science could easily and relatively cheaply be useful 12

heritage dictionary of the english language see template ahdict the american heritage dictionary of the english language ahd is an american dictionary of english published by boston publisher houghton mifflin the first edition of which appeared in 1969 its creation was spurred by the controversy over the webster s third new international dictionary history edit james parton the publisher and co-owner of the history magazine american heritage was appalled by the permissiveness of webster s third published in 1961 and tried to buy the g and c merriam company so he could undo the changes when that failed he contracted with houghton to publish a new dictionary the ahd was edited by william morris and relied on a usage panel of 105 writers speakers and eminent persons chosen for their well-known conservatism in the use of language 1 however morris made inconsistent use of the panels often ignoring their advice and inserting his own opinions 1 linguistics edit the ahd broke ground among dictionaries by using corpus linguistics for compiling word frequencies and other information it took the innovative step of combining prescriptive information how language should be used and descriptive information how it actually is used the descriptive information was derived from actual texts citations were based on a million-word three-line citation database prepared by brown university linguist henry kučera usage panel edit for expert consultation on words or constructions whose usage is controversial or problematic the american heritage dictionary relies on the advice of a usage panel in its current form the panel comprises nearly 200 prominent members of professions whose work demands sensitivity to language present and former members of the usage panel include novelists isaac asimov barbara kingsolver david foster wallace and eudora welty poets rita dove galway kinnell mary oliver and robert pinsky playwrights terrence mcnally and marsha norman journalists liane hansen and susan stamberg literary critics harold bloom columnists and commentators william f buckley jr and robert j samuelson linguists and cognitive scientists anne curzan steven pinker and calvert watkins and humorists garrison keillor david sedaris and alison bechdel pinker author of the style guide the sense of style is its current chair as of 2016 update 2 the members of the panel are sent regular ballots asking about matters of usage the completed ballots are returned and tabulated and the results form the basis for special usage notes appended to the relevant dictionary entries in many cases these notes not only report the percentage of panelists who consider a given usage or construction to be acceptable but will also report the results from balloting of the same question in past decades to give a clearer sense of how the language changes over time illustrations edit the ahd is also somewhat innovative in its liberal use of photographic illustrations which at the time was highly unusual for general reference dictionaries many of which went largely or completely unillustrated it also has an unusually large number of biographical entries for notable persons first edition edit the first edition appeared in 1969 highly praised for its indo-european etymologies in addition to the normally expected etymologies which for instance trace the word ambiguous to a proto-indo-european root ag- meaning to drive the appendices included a seven-page article by professor calvert watkins entitled indo-european and the indo-europeans and indo-european roots 46 pages of entries that are each organized around one of some thousand proto-indo-european roots and the english words of the ahd that are understood to have evolved from them these entries might be called reverse etymologies the ag entry there for instance lists 49 terms derived from it words as diverse as agent essay purge stratagem ambassador axiom and pellagra along with information about varying routes through intermediate transformations on the way to the contemporary words a compacted american heritage college dictionary was first released in 1974 second and later editions edit the first edition s concise successor the american heritage dictionary second college edition was published in 1982 without a larger-format version it omitted the indo-european etymologies but they were reintroduced in the third full edition published in 1992 the third edition was also a departure for the publisher because it was developed in a database which facilitated the use of the linguistic data for other applications such as electronic dictionaries the fourth edition 2000 reissued in 2006 added an appendix of semitic language etymological roots and included color illustrations and was also available with a cd-rom edition in some versions this revision was larger than a typical desk dictionary but smaller than webster s third new international dictionary or the unabridged random house dictionary of the english language a lower-priced college edition also the fourth was issued in black-and-white printing and with fewer illustrations in 2002 reprinted in 2007 and 2010 the fifth and most recent full edition was published in november 2011 3 with new printings in 2012 and 2016 it is available in hardcover and with reduced print size and smaller page count trade paperback form it dropped several of the supplementary features of the fourth edition and is not available with a disc-based electronic version the university-student version was rebranded the american heritage college writer s dictionary in 2013 and stripped of biographical and geographical entries to make room for more vocabulary while simultaneously reducing the number of pages compared to the fourth college edition the ahd inserts minor revisions such as a biographical entry with photograph for each newly elected u.s president in successive printings of any given edition supporting volumes have been issued including the american heritage book of english usage the american heritage dictionary of indo-european roots the american heritage abbreviations dictionary the american heritage

partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it and with a free connection to the open sea 1 estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments they are subject both to marine influences—such as tides waves and the influx of saline water—and to riverine influences—such as flows of fresh water and sediment the inflows of both sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world 2 most existing estuaries formed during the holocene epoch with the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about 10,000–12,000 years ago 3 estuaries are typically classified according to their geomorphological features or to water-circulation patterns they can have many different names such as bays harbors lagoons inlets or sounds although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the above definition of an estuary and may be fully saline the banks of many estuaries are amongst the most heavily populated areas of the world with about 60 of the world s population living along estuaries and the coast citation needed as a result many estuaries suffer degradation by many factors including sedimentation from soil erosion from deforestation overgrazing and other poor farming practices overfishing drainage and filling of wetlands eutrophication due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes pollutants including heavy metals polychlorinated biphenyls radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion 3 4 definition edit new york–new jersey

estuary mouth of the yachats river in yachats oregon amazon estuary the word estuary is derived from the latin word aestuarium meaning tidal inlet of the sea which in itself is derived from the term aestus meaning tide there have been many definitions proposed to describe an estuary the most widely accepted definition is a semi-enclosed coastal body of water which has a free connection with the open sea and within which sea water is measurably diluted with freshwater derived from land drainage 1 however this definition excludes a number of coastal water bodies such as coastal lagoons and brackish seas a more comprehensive definition of an estuary is a semi-enclosed body of water connected to the sea as far as the tidal limit or the salt intrusion limit and receiving freshwater runoff however the freshwater inflow may not be perennial the connection to the sea may be closed for part of the year and tidal influence may be negligible 3 this broad definition also includes fjords lagoons river mouths and tidal creeks an estuary is a dynamic ecosystem having a connection to the open sea through which the sea water enters with the rhythm of the tides the sea water entering the estuary is diluted by the fresh water flowing from rivers and streams the pattern of dilution varies between different estuaries and depends on the volume of fresh water the tidal range and the extent of evaporation of the water in the estuary 2 classification based on geomorphology edit drowned river valleys edit main article ria drowned river valleys are also known as coastal plain estuaries in places where the sea level is rising relative to the land sea water progressively penetrates into river valleys and the topography of the estuary remains similar to that of a river valley this is the most common type of estuary in temperate climates well-studied estuaries include the severn estuary in the united kingdom and the ems dollard along the dutch-german border the width-to-depth ratio of these estuaries is typically large appearing wedge-shaped in cross-section in the inner part and broadening and deepening seaward water depths rarely exceed 30 m 100 ft examples of this type of estuary in the u.s are the hudson river chesapeake bay and delaware bay along the mid-atlantic coast and galveston bay and tampa bay along the gulf coast 5 lagoon-type or bar-built edit bar-built estuaries are found in place where the deposition of sediment has kept pace with rising sea level so that the estuaries are shallow and separated from the sea by sand spits or barrier islands they are relatively common in tropical and subtropical locations these estuaries are semi-isolated from ocean waters by barrier beaches barrier islands and barrier spits formation of barrier beaches partially encloses the estuary with only narrow inlets allowing contact with the ocean waters bar-built estuaries typically develop on gently sloping plains located along tectonically stable edges of continents and marginal sea coasts they are extensive along the atlantic and gulf coasts of the u.s in areas with active coastal deposition of sediments and where tidal ranges are less than 4 m 13 ft the barrier beaches that enclose bar-built estuaries have been developed in several ways building up of offshore bars by wave action in which sand from the sea floor is deposited in elongated bars parallel to the shoreline reworking of sediment discharge from rivers by wave current and wind action into beaches overwash flats and dunes engulfment of mainland beach ridges ridges developed from the erosion of coastal plain sediments around 5000 years ago due to sea level rise and resulting in the breaching of the ridges and flooding of the coastal lowlands forming shallow lagoons and elongation of barrier spits from the erosion of headlands due to the action of longshore currents with the spits growing in the direction of the littoral drift barrier beaches form in shallow water and are generally parallel to the shoreline resulting in long narrow estuaries the average water depth is usually less than 5 m 16 ft and rarely exceeds 10 m 33 ft examples of bar-built estuaries are barnegat bay new jersey laguna madre 6 texas and pamlico sound north carolina fjord-type edit fjords were formed where pleistocene glaciers deepened and widened existing river valleys so that they become u-shaped in cross sections at their mouths there are typically rocks bars or sills of glacial deposits which have the effects of modifying the estuarine circulation fjord-type estuaries are formed in deeply eroded valleys formed by glaciers these u-shaped estuaries typically have steep sides rock bottoms and underwater sills contoured by glacial movement the estuary is shallowest at its mouth where terminal glacial moraines or rock bars form sills that restrict water flow in the upper reaches of the estuary the depth can exceed 300 m 1,000 ft the width-to-depth ratio is generally small in estuaries with very shallow sills tidal oscillations only affect the water down to the depth of the sill and the waters deeper than that may remain stagnant for a very long time so there is only an occasional exchange of the deep water of the estuary with the ocean if the sill depth is deep water circulation is less restricted and there is a slow but steady exchange of water between the estuary and the ocean fjord-type estuaries can be found along the coasts of alaska the puget sound region of western washington state british columbia eastern canada greenland iceland new zealand and norway tectonically produced edit these estuaries are formed by subsidence or land cut off from the ocean by land movement associated with faulting volcanoes and landslides inundation from eustatic sea level rise during the holocene epoch has also contributed to the formation of these estuaries there are only a small number of tectonically produced estuaries one example is the san francisco bay which was formed by the crustal movements of the san andreas fault system causing the inundation of the lower reaches of the sacramento and san joaquin rivers 7 classification based on water circulation edit see also estuarine water circulation salt wedge edit in this type of estuary river output greatly exceeds marine input and tidal effects have a minor importance fresh water floats on top of the seawater in a layer that gradually thins as it moves seaward the denser seawater moves landward along the bottom of the estuary forming a wedge-shaped layer that is thinner as it approaches land as a velocity difference develops between the two layers shear forces generate internal waves at the interface mixing the seawater upward with the freshwater an example of a salt wedge estuary is the mississippi river 7 partially mixed edit as tidal forcing increases river output becomes less than the marine input here current induced turbulence causes mixing of the whole water column such that salinity varies more longitudinally rather than vertically leading to a moderately stratified condition examples include the chesapeake bay and narragansett bay 7 well-mixed edit tidal mixing forces exceed river output resulting in a well mixed water column and the disappearance of the vertical salinity gradient the freshwater-seawater boundary is eliminated due to the intense turbulent mixing and eddy effects the lower reaches of delaware bay and the raritan river in new jersey are examples of vertically homogenous estuaries 7 inverse edit inverse estuaries occur in dry climates where evaporation greatly exceeds the inflow of fresh water a salinity maximum zone is formed and both riverine and oceanic water flow close to the surface towards this zone 8 this water is pushed downward and spreads along the bottom in both the seaward and landward direction 3 an example of an inverse estuary is spencer gulf south australia intermittent edit estuary type varies dramatically depending on freshwater input and is capable of changing from a wholly marine embayment to any of the other estuary types 9 10 physiochemical variation edit the most important variable characteristics of estuary water are the concentration of dissolved oxygen salinity and sediment load there is extreme spatial variability in salinity with a range of near zero at the tidal limit of tributary rivers to 3.4 at the estuary mouth at any one point the salinity will vary considerably over time and seasons making it a harsh environment for organisms sediment often settles in intertidal mudflats which are extremely difficult to colonize no points of attachment exist for algae so vegetation based habitat is not established clarification needed sediment can also clog feeding and respiratory structures of species and special adaptations exist within mudflat species to cope with this problem lastly dissolved oxygen variation can cause problems for life forms nutrient-rich sediment from man-made sources can promote primary production life cycles perhaps leading to eventual decay removing the dissolved oxygen from the water thus hypoxic or anoxic zones can develop 11 implications for marine life edit estuaries provide habitats for a large number of organisms and support very high productivity estuaries provide habitats for many fish nurseries depending upon their locations in the world such as salmon and sea trout 12 also migratory bird populations such as the black-tailed godwit 13 make essential use of estuaries two of the main challenges of estuarine life are the variability in salinity and sedimentation many species of fish and invertebrates have various methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations and are termed osmoconformers and osmoregulators many animals also burrow to avoid predation and to live in the more stable sedimental environment however large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand this reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially anoxic conditions which can be further exacerbated by limited water flux phytoplankton are key primary producers in estuaries they move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the tides their productivity is largely dependent upon the turbidity of the water the main phytoplankton present are diatoms and dinoflagellates which are abundant in the sediment it is important to remember that a primary source of food for many organisms on estuaries including bacteria is detritus from the settlement of the sedimentation human impact edit of the thirty-two largest cities in the world twenty-two are located on estuaries 14 as ecosystems estuaries are under threat from human activities such as pollution and overfishing they are also threatened by sewage coastal settlement land clearance and much more estuaries are affected by events far upstream and concentrate materials such as pollutants and sediments 15 land run-off and industrial agricultural and domestic waste enter rivers and are discharged into estuaries contaminants can be introduced which do not disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment such as plastics pesticides furans dioxins phenols and heavy metals such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called bioaccumulation they also accumulate in benthic environments such as estuaries and bay muds a geological record of human activities of the last century the elemental composition of biofilm reflect areas of the estuary impacted by human activities and over time may shift the basic composition of the ecosystem and the reversible or irreversible changes in the abiotic and biotic parts of the systems from the bottom up 16 for example chinese and russian industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals has devastated fish stocks in the amur river and damaged its estuary soil 17 estuaries tend to be naturally eutrophic because land runoff discharges nutrients into estuaries with human activities land run-off also now includes the many chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture as well as waste from livestock and humans excess oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water can lead to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones 18 this can result in reductions in water quality fish and other animal populations overfishing also occurs chesapeake bay once had a flourishing oyster population that has been almost wiped out by overfishing oysters filter these pollutants and either eat them or shape them into small packets that are deposited on the bottom where they are harmless historically the oysters filtered the estuary s entire water volume of excess nutrients every three or four days today that process takes almost a year 19 and sediment nutrients and algae can cause problems in local waters examples edit africa edit orange river estuary asia edit gulf of ob yenisei gulf europe edit the gironde golden

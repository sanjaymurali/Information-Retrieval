azores high wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the azores high portuguese anticiclone dos açores also known as north atlantic subtropical high anticyclone or the bermuda-azores high is a large subtropical semi-permanent centre of high atmospheric pressure typically found south of the azores in the atlantic ocean at the horse latitudes it forms one pole of the north atlantic oscillation the other being the icelandic low the system influences the weather and climatic patterns of vast areas of north africa and southern europe and to a lesser extent eastern north america the aridity of the sahara desert and the summer drought of the mediterranean basin is due to the large-scale subsidence and sinking motion of air in the system in its summer position the bermuda high the high is centered near bermuda and creates a southwest flow of warm tropical air toward the east coast of the united states in summer the azores-bermuda high is strongest the central pressure hovers around 1024 mbar hpa tropical wave formation on the atlantic ocean this high-pressure block exhibits anticyclonic nature circulating the air clockwise due to this direction of movement african eastern waves are impelled along the southern periphery of the azores high away from coastal west africa towards the caribbean central america or the bahamas favouring tropical cyclogenesis especially during the hurricane season variations edit see also north atlantic oscillation and tropical upper tropospheric trough research into global warming suggests that it may be intensifying the bermuda high in some years independently of oscillations such as enso leading to more precipitation extremes across the southeastern united states latitudinal displacement of the ridge is also occurring and computer models depict more westward expansion of the anticyclone in the future 1 2 however during the winter of 2009–2010 the azores high was smaller displaced to the northeast and weaker than usual allowing sea surface temperatures in the central atlantic to increase quickly 3

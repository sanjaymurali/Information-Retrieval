normal and sport variants the sport having a two-part seat no grab rail and no main stand though the main stand mounting holes remained fuel injection allows for more precise fuel metering and delivery over a wider rpm range while providing better throttle response and reducing emissions the injectors reside one per cylinder and work with 38 mm throttle bodies each injector has four nozzles and together the injectors add up to five horsepower over the f4 weight was also reduced the rear wheel was made lighter and the front wheel 9 the rotor carriers moved out closer to the brake calipers to reduce weight and to improve rigidity but stopping power still was not on par with other bikes in the class there is additional bracing on the steering head for more response better feedback and feel from the front end the suspension has also been tweaked with less high-speed damping and a little more low-speed damping with the shock and fork being more street-bias 13 honda cbr600f

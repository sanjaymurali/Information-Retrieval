sensible heat wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search sensible heat is heat exchanged by a body or thermodynamic system in which the exchange of heat changes the temperature of the body or system and some macroscopic variables of the body or system but leaves unchanged certain other macroscopic variables of the body or system such as volume or pressure 1 2 3 4 usage edit thermodynamics the classical carnot heat engine branches classical statistical chemical equilibrium  non-equilibrium laws zeroth first second third systems state equation of state ideal gas real gas state of matter equilibrium control volume instruments processes isobaric isochoric isothermal adiabatic isentropic isenthalpic quasistatic polytropic free expansion reversibility irreversibility endoreversibility cycles heat engines heat pumps thermal efficiency system properties note conjugate variables in italics property diagrams intensive and extensive properties functions of state temperature  entropy  introduction pressure  volume chemical potential  particle number vapor quality reduced properties process functions work heat material properties property databases specific heat capacity  c displaystyle c t displaystyle t ∂ s displaystyle partial s n displaystyle n ∂ t displaystyle partial t compressibility  β − displaystyle beta 1 displaystyle 1 ∂ v displaystyle partial v v displaystyle v ∂ p displaystyle partial p thermal expansion  α displaystyle alpha 1 displaystyle 1 ∂ v displaystyle partial v v displaystyle v ∂ t displaystyle partial t equations carnot s theorem clausius theorem fundamental relation ideal gas law maxwell relations onsager reciprocal relations bridgman s equations table of thermodynamic equations potentials free energy free entropy internal energy u s v displaystyle u s,v enthalpy h s p u p v displaystyle h s,p u pv helmholtz free energy a t v u − t s displaystyle a t,v u-ts gibbs free energy g t p h − t s displaystyle g t,p h-ts history culture history general heat entropy gas laws perpetual motion machines philosophy entropy and time entropy and life brownian ratchet maxwell s demon heat death paradox loschmidt s paradox synergetics theories caloric theory theory of heat vis viva living force mechanical equivalent of heat motive power key publications an experimental enquiry concerning . heat on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances reflections on the motive power of fire timelines thermodynamics heat engines art education maxwell s thermodynamic surface entropy as energy dispersal scientists bernoulli boltzmann carnot clapeyron clausius carathéodory duhem gibbs von helmholtz joule maxwell von mayer onsager rankine smeaton stahl thompson thomson van der waals waterston book thermodynamics v t e the term is used in contrast to a latent heat which is the amount of heat exchanged that is hidden meaning it occurs without change of temperature for example during a phase change such as the melting of ice the temperature of the system containing the ice and the liquid is constant until all ice has melted the terms latent and sensible are correlative that means that they are defined as a pair depending on which other macroscopic variables are held constant during the process the sensible heat of a thermodynamic process may be calculated as the product of the body s mass m with its specific heat capacity c and the change in temperature Δ t displaystyle delta t q s e n s i b l e m c Δ t displaystyle q sensible mc delta t joule described sensible heat as the energy measured by a thermometer sensible heat and latent heat are not special forms of energy rather they describe exchanges of heat under conditions specified in terms of their effect on a material or a thermodynamic system in the writings of the early scientists who provided the foundations of thermodynamics sensible heat had a clear meaning in calorimetry james prescott joule characterized it in 1847 as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer 5 both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes while transporting energy in nature latent heat is associated with changes of state measured at constant temperature especially the phase changes of atmospheric water vapor mostly vaporization and condensation whereas sensible heat directly affects the temperature of the atmosphere in meteorology the term sensible heat flux means the conductive heat flux from the earth s surface to the atmosphere 6 it is an important component of earth s surface energy budget sensible heat flux is commonly measured with the eddy covariance method

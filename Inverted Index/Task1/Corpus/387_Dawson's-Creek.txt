in and around wilmington north carolina its bays and coastlines are similar to those found along the coast of massachusetts capeside high school is the high school in capeside massachusetts attended by several characters during the first four seasons of the show exteriors were filmed at the university of north carolina at wilmington a dawson creek actually exists in the canadian province of british columbia it is named for the river of the same name that runs through it another exists in oriental nc which flows into the neuse river this served as the inspiration for the show s name there is also a dawson s creek that runs through baton rouge louisiana restaurants and bars in the show edit interiors for the icehouse were filmed at the icehouse bar in downtown wilmington several blocks from less picturesque water so exteriors were filmed at the dockside restaurant at 1308 airlie road in wrightsville beach nc nearby constructions at the real icehouse forced producers to eliminate the bar from the storyline by burning it down 9 the hell s kitchen bar featured in the show was a natural food store at 118 princess street in wilmington which was purchased by producers dressed as a

over two hours away at duke university 12 and a number of its students served as extras 12 some filming was also done on franklin street adjacent to nearby university of north carolina at chapel hill reception edit critical reception edit dawson s creek generated a high amount of publicity before its debut with several television critics and consumer watchdog groups expressing concerns about its anticipated racy plots and dialogue the controversy drove one of the original production companies away from the project 8 13 john kiesewetter television columnist for the cincinnati enquirer wrote as much as i want to love the show—the cool kids charming new england setting and stunning cinematography—i can t get past the consuming preoccupation with sex sex sex 13 in his defense williamson denied this was his intention stating that i never set out to make something provocative and racy 13 syndicated columnist john leo said the show should be called when parents cringe and went on to write the first episode contains a good deal of chatter about breasts genitalia masturbation and penis size then the title and credits come on and the story begins tom shales of the washington post commented that creator kevin williamson was the most overrated wunderkind in hollywood and what he s brilliant at is pandering the parents television council proclaimed the show as the single worst program of the 1997–98 and 1998-99 seasons by being the crudest of the network shows aimed at kids complaining about an almost obsessive focus on pre-marital sexual activity references to pornography and condoms and the show s acceptance of homosexuality 14 the council also cited it as the fourth worst show in 2000–2001 15 former upn president lucie salhany criticized wb for airing dawson s creek which features adolescent characters in adult situations in an early timeslot while the network is supposed to be the family network 16 however on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum the national organization for women offered an endorsement deeming it one of the least sexually exploitative shows on the air despite the controversy surrounding the sexual-oriented topics the show was a major critical success before its premiere san francisco chronicle explained the buzz around the show was due to its creator kevin williamson who wrote the screenplays for scream and scream 2 and that the show might be one of the year s tangier hits he also found dawson s creek scenically downright luxuriant and liked that it doesn t have the rushed feel of so many teen shows the edginess is in the situations not the pacing 17 variety wrote that it was an addictive drama with considerable heart...the teenage equivalent of a woody allen movie—a kind of deconstructing puberty 18 the atlanta journal-constitution called it a teen s dream the dayton daily news listed capeside as a television town they d most like to live in the seattle times declared it the best show of the 1997–1998 season and said it belongs to the small-pantheon my so-called life james at 15 and to a lesser extent party of five and doogie howser m.d. 19 awards and accolades edit dawson s creek was nominated for

americans was made by the same company as dawson s creek columbia tristar television and appeared in dawson s creek s timeslot when it went on hiatus during the summer of 2000 the show had 8 episodes the reason the show is considered a semi-spinoff instead of a true spinoff is that will was not originally created for dawson s creek he was added to dawson s solely to set up and promote the series

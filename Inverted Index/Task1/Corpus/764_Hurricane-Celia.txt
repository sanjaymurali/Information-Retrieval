saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave emerged into the atlantic ocean from the west coast of africa in late july a weather station in dakar senegal observed a wind shift on july 23 the system moved quickly across the atlantic at 20 and 25 mph 32 and 40 km h and reached the lesser antilles by july 28 1 the wave then continued moving rapidly westward across the caribbean sea however falling atmospheric pressures over the southern united states eroded a subtropical ridge causing the system to decelerate by july 30 around that time a closed circulation began to organize in the northwestern caribbean between the cayman islands and swan island 2 at 0000 utc on july 31 a tropical depression developed about 90 mi 145 km west-southwest of grand cayman 3 the depression strengthened while heading north-northwestward though a reconnaissance aircraft could not complete its mission on july 31 due to the depression s proximity to cuba 2 early on august 1 the depression made landfall in western pinar del río province cuba 3 a weather station in cape san antonio recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 1,007 mbar 29.7 inhg after reaching the southeastern gulf of mexico on august 1 warm sea surface temperatures caused the depression to undergo rapid deepening later that day the depression reached tropical storm intensity and was named celia based on a reconnaissance flight observing tropical storm force winds 2 satellite imagery indicated that celia was becoming significantly more organized 4 at 0000 utc on august 2 reconnaissance aircraft data indicated that celia suddenly strengthened into a category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 115 mph 185 km h 3 4 however the storm weakened to a category 2 hurricane about six hours later 3 due to celia s steady west-northwestward motion across the gulf of mexico the national hurricane center marked that the storm aimed at the corpus christi area like a wild beast stalking its prey 4 early on august 3 it weakened further to a category 1 hurricane 3 unexpectedly celia underwent rapid deepening once again while nearing the coast of texas later on august 3 including a 39 mbar 1.2 inhg decrease in pressure in only 15 hours 4 at 1800 utc on august 3 celia attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph 205 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 945 mbar 27.9 inhg shortly thereafter the storm made landfall near corpus christi texas at the same intensity 3 celia maintained strength for an unusually long time after moving inland 4 weakening to a tropical storm at 0600 utc on august 4 early on the following day the storm further weakened to a tropical depression celia dissipated over western texas at 1800 utc on august 5 3 though the remnants persisted until

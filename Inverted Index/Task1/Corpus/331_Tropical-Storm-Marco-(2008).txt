reported damage minimal areas affected mexico part of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season tropical storm marco was the smallest tropical cyclone on record the thirteenth named storm of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern caribbean during late september 2008 influenced by a tropical wave on october 4 a small low-level circulation center developed over belize after crossing the southern end of the yucatán peninsula and emerging into the bay of campeche the low was declared tropical depression thirteen early on october 6 the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name marco later that day marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph 100 km h early on october 7 around this time tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles 18.5 km from the center of the storm making marco the smallest tropical cyclone on record 1 2 around 1200 utc marco made landfall near misantla veracruz the storm rapidly weakened after landfall dissipating later that day due to its small size marco caused minimal damage however the storm s heavy rains led to floods up to 10 feet 3.05 m deep that covered highways and damaged homes meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale tropical storm marco originated in a broad area of low pressure that persisted over the northwestern caribbean in late september 2008 on october 4 a tropical wave reached the same area and the system spawned a circulation center over belize development of the low was initially inhibited by its proximity to land as the system neared the bay of campeche convection quickly developed around the low at 0000 utc on october 6 the low was designated as tropical depression thirteen while located over laguna de términos 2 a mid-level ridge located to the north of the depression led to movement in a general west-northwest direction forecasters anticipated intensification up until landfall because of the storm s well-developed outflow and the low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures in its path 3 by 1200 utc the small cyclone with a cloud shield no more than 85 miles 137 kilometers across was upgraded to tropical storm marco 2 favorable conditions for development allowed marco to quickly intensify throughout the day on october 6 early on october 7 marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph 105 km h and a minimum pressure of 998 millibar hpa 29.47 inhg 2 this was based on a reconnaissance mission into marco which recorded flight-level winds of 70 mph 110 km h corresponding to a surface wind speed of 61 mph 98 km h following the quick increase in intensity forecasters noted the possibility of marco intensifying into a hurricane before making landfall 4 the storm maintained a small area of deep convection averaging 9.2 miles 14.8 km in diameter as it continued moving towards the west-northwest 5 shortly after reaching peak intensity tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles 18.5 km from the center of marco 6 at 1200 utc the center of marco made landfall near misantla veracruz with winds of 65 mph 105 km h 2 once inland marco rapidly weakened 7 being downgraded to a tropical depression six hours after landfall the small depression dissipated later that day over the mountains of mexico 2 preparations impact and records edit see also tropical cyclone warnings and watches tropical storms marco center norbert bottom left and the low that would eventually become odile bottom on october 6 upon the storm s formation the government of mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the gulf of mexico from tuxpan to punta el lagarto 8 that afternoon the government issued a hurricane watch between cabo rojo and veracruz and extended the tropical storm warning northward to cabo rojo 9 officials closed schools ahead of the storm and opened 200 shelters 10 an estimated 3,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas along the coast 11 soldiers used school buses to transport evacuees to the shelters 10 marco formed in the area of mexico s main oil-facilities 12 leading to the evacuation of 33 workers from four platforms six oil wells and a natural gas processing plant were also shut down in veracruz 10 the mexican secretariat of communications and transportation also closed the ports of nautla and alvarado to small vessels as a precautionary measure 13 marco shortly after being upgraded to a tropical storm on october 6 upon landfall heavy rains peaking at 7.9 inches 201 millimeters in el pujal san luis potosí 14 and falling at rates up to 1 inch per hour 25.4 mm h 2 caused some flooding in coastal towns near veracruz as people evacuated to higher ground 15 the rains from marco worsened flood situations in areas of mexico already suffering from severe flooding 10 officials in veracruz in their post-storm damage survey reported that two rivers the quilate and tenoch overflowed their banks due to rains produced by marco 16 one of these rivers left the towns of minatitlan and hidalgotitlan under 10 ft 3 m of water 10 highways along the coast of veracruz were also flooded 17 another 250 homes were flooded when a lake and a river overflowed their banks 18 thirteen municipalities within veracruz were affected by

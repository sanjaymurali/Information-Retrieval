supercell wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the weather phenomenon for other uses see supercell disambiguation moisture streams in from the side of the precipitation free base and merges into a line of warm uplift region where the tower of the thundercloud is tipped by high altitude shear winds the high shear causes horizontal vorticity which is tilted within the updraft to become vertical vorticity and the mass of clouds spins as it gains altitude up to the cap which can be up to the 55,000 feet 17,000 m –70,000 feet 21,000 m above ground for the largest storms and trailing anvil the capped moisture laden air is cooled enough to precipitate as it is rotated toward the cooler region represented by the turbulent air of the mammatus clouds where the warm air is spilling over top of the cooler invading air the cap is formed where shear winds block further uplift for a time until a relative weakness allows a breakthrough of the cap an overshooting top cooler air to the right in the image may or may not form a shelf cloud but the precipitation zone will occur where the heat engine of the uplift intermingles with the invading colder air as the cooler but drier air circulates into the warm moisture laden inflow the cloud base will frequently form a wall and the cloud base often experiences a lowering which in extreme cases are where tornadoes are formed a low precipitation supercell shelf cloud shelf cloud forms when a cooler air mass under-flows the warmer moisture laden air a supercell while many ordinary thunderstorms squall line single-cell multi-cell are similar in appearance supercells are distinguishable by their large-scale rotation play media supercells forming near deshler nebraska united states a supercell thunderstorm over pikes peak as seen from palmer park a supercell is a thunderstorm characterized by the presence of a mesocyclone a deep persistently rotating updraft 1 for this reason these storms are sometimes referred to as rotating thunderstorms 2 of the four classifications of thunderstorms supercell squall line multi-cell and single-cell supercells are the overall least common and have the potential to be the most severe supercells are often isolated from other thunderstorms and can dominate the local weather up to 32 kilometres 20 mi away supercells are often put into three classification types classic low-precipitation lp and high-precipitation hp lp supercells are usually found in climates that are more arid such as the high plains of the united states and hp supercells are most often found in moist climates supercells can occur anywhere in the world under the right pre-existing weather conditions but they are most common in the great plains of the united states in an area known as tornado alley and in the tornado corridor of argentina uruguay and southern brazil characteristics edit supercells are usually found isolated from other thunderstorms although they can sometimes be embedded in a squall line typically supercells are found in the warm sector of a low pressure system propagating generally in a north easterly direction in line with the cold front of the low pressure system because they can last for hours they are known as quasi-steady-state storms supercells have the capability to deviate from the mean wind if they track to the right or left of the mean wind relative to the vertical wind shear they are said to be right-movers or left-movers respectively supercells can sometimes develop two separate updrafts with opposing rotations which splits the storm into two supercells one left-mover and one right-mover supercells can be any size – large or small low or high topped they usually produce copious amounts of hail torrential rainfall strong winds and substantial downbursts supercells are one of the few types of clouds that typically spawn tornadoes within the mesocyclone although only 30 or fewer do so 3 geography edit supercells can occur anywhere in the world under the right weather conditions the first storm to be identified as the supercell type was the wokingham storm over england which was studied by keith browning and frank ludlam in 1962 4 browning did the initial work that was followed up by lemon and doswell to develop the modern conceptual model of the supercell 5 to the extent that records are available supercells are most frequent in the great plains of the central united states and southern canada extending into the southeastern u.s and northern mexico east-central argentina and adjacent regions of uruguay bangladesh and parts of eastern india south africa and eastern australia 6 supercells occur occasionally in many other mid-latitude regions including eastern china and throughout europe the areas with highest frequencies of supercells are similar to those with the most occurrences of tornadoes see tornado climatology and tornado alley anatomy of a supercell edit the current conceptual model of a supercell was described in severe thunderstorm evolution and mesocyclone structure as related to tornadogenesis by leslie r lemon and charles a doswell iii see lemon technique supercells derive their rotation through tilting of horizontal vorticity an invisible horizontal vortex caused by wind shear strong updrafts lift the air turning about a horizontal axis and cause this air to turn about a vertical axis this forms the deep rotating updraft the mesocyclone a cap or capping inversion is usually required to form an updraft of sufficient strength the cap puts an inverted warm-above-cold layer above a normal cold-above-warm boundary layer and by preventing warm surface air from rising allows one or both of the following air below the cap warms and or becomes more moist air above the cap cools this creates a warmer moister layer below a cooler layer which is increasingly unstable because warm air is less dense and tends to rise when the cap weakens or moves explosive development follows in north america supercells usually show up on doppler radar as starting at a point or hook shape on the southwestern side fanning out to the northeast the heaviest precipitation is usually on the southwest side ending abruptly short of the rain-free updraft base or main updraft not visible to radar the rear flank downdraft or rfd carries precipitation counterclockwise around the north and northwest side of the updraft base producing a hook echo that indicates the presence of a mesocyclone wind shear red sets air spinning green the updraft blue bends the spinning air upwards the updraft starts rotating with the spinning column of air structure of a supercell edit structure of a supercell northwestward view in the northern hemisphere diagram of supercell from above rfd rear flank downdraft ffd front flank downdraft v v-notch u main updraft i updraft downdraft interface h hook echo overshooting top edit this dome feature appears above the strongest updraft location on the anvil of the storm it is a result of a very powerful updraft enough to break through the upper levels of the troposphere an observer who is at ground level too close to the storm is unable to see the overshooting top due to the fact that the anvil blocks the sight of this feature the overshooting is visible from satellite images as a bubbling amidst the otherwise smooth upper surface of the anvil cloud anvil edit an anvil forms when the storm s updraft collides with the upper levels of the lowest layer of the atmosphere or the troposphere and has nowhere else to go due to the laws of fluid dynamics specifically pressure humidity and density the anvil is very cold and virtually precipitation free even though virga can be seen falling from the forward sheared anvil since there is so little moisture in the anvil winds can move freely the clouds take on their anvil shape when the rising air reaches 15,200–21,300 metres 50,000–70,000 ft or more the anvil s distinguishing feature is that it juts out in front of the storm like a shelf in some cases it can even shear backwards called a backsheared anvil another sign of a very strong updraft precipitation-free base edit this area typically on the southern side of the storm in north america is relatively precipitation free this is located beneath the main updraft and is the main area of inflow while no precipitation may be visible to an observer large hail may be falling from this area a region of this area is called the vault it is more accurately called the main updraft area wall cloud edit the wall cloud forms near the downdraft updraft interface this interface is the area between the precipitation area and the precipitation-free base wall clouds form when rain-cooled air from the downdraft is pulled into the updraft this wet cold air quickly saturates as it is lifted by the updraft forming a cloud that seems to descend from the precipitation-free base wall clouds are common and are not exclusive to supercells only a small percentage actually produce a tornado but if a storm does produce a tornado it usually exhibits wall clouds that persist for more than ten minutes wall clouds that seem to move violently up or down and violent movements of cloud fragments scud or fractus near the wall cloud are indications that a tornado could form mammatus clouds edit mammatus mamma mammatocumulus are bulbous or pillow-like cloud formations extending from beneath the anvil of a thunderstorm these clouds form as cold air in the anvil region of a storm sinks into warmer air beneath it mammatus are most apparent when they are lit from one side or below and are therefore at their most impressive near sunset or shortly after sunrise when the sun is low in the sky mammatus are not exclusive to supercells and can be associated with developed thunderstorms and cumulonimbus forward flank downdraft ffd edit this is generally the area of heaviest and most widespread precipitation for most supercells the precipitation core is bounded on its leading edge by a shelf cloud that results from rain-cooled air within the precipitation core spreading outward and interacting with warmer moist air from outside of the cell between the precipitation-free base and the ffd a vaulted or cathedral feature can be observed in high precipitation supercells an area of heavy precipitation may occur beneath the main updraft area where the vault would alternately be observed with classic supercells rear flank downdraft rfd edit main article rear flank downdraft the rfd of a supercell is a very complex and not yet fully understood feature rfd mainly occur within classic and hp supercells although rfds have been observed within lp supercells the rfd of a supercell is believed to play a large part in tornadogenesis by further tightening rotation within the surface mesocyclone rfds are caused by mid level steering winds of a supercell colliding with the updraft tower and moving around it in all directions specifically the flow that is redirected downward is referred to as the rfd this downward surge of relatively cool mid level air due to interactions between dew points humidity and condensation of the converging of air masses can reach very high speeds and is known to cause widespread wind damage the radar signature of an rfd is a hook like structure where sinking air has brought with it precipitation vault edit a vault is not observed with all supercells the vault can only be identified visibly due to it visibly appearing to be free of precipitation but usually containing large hail on doppler radar the region of very high precipitation echos with a very sharp gradient perpendicular to the rfd flanking line edit a flanking line is a line of smaller cumulonimbi or cumulus that form in the warm rising air pulled in by the main updraft due to convergence and lifting along this line landspouts sometimes occur on the outflow boundary of this region radar features of a supercell edit radar reflectivity map hook echo or pendant the hook echo is the area of confluence between the main updraft and the rear flank downdraft rfd this indicates the position of the mesocyclone and probably a tornado bounded weak echo region or bwer this is a region of low radar reflectivity bounded above by an area of higher radar reflectivity with an untilted updraft this is evidence of a strong updraft and oftentimes the presence of a tornado inflow notch a notch of weak reflectivity on the inflow side of the cell this is not a v-notch v notch a v shaped notch on the leading edge of the cell opening away from the main downdraft this is an indication of divergent flow around a powerful updraft hail spike this three body scatter spike is a region of weak echoes found radially behind the main reflectivity core at higher elevations when large hail is present 7 supercell variations edit supercell thunderstorms are sometimes classified by meteorologists and storm spotters into three categories however not all supercells fit neatly into any one category being hybrid storms and many supercells may fall into different categories during different periods of their lifetimes the standard definition given above is referred to as the classic supercell all types of supercells typically produce severe weather low precipitation lp edit schematics of an lp supercell idealized view of an lp supercell lp supercells contain a small and relatively light precipitation rain hail core that is well separated from the updraft the updraft is intense and lps are inflow dominant storms the updraft tower is typically more strongly tilted and the deviant rightward motion lesser than for other supercell types the forward flank downdraft ffd is noticeably weaker than for other supercell types and the rear-flank downdraft rfd is much weaker—even visually absent in many cases like classic supercells lp supercells tend to form within stronger mid-to-upper level storm-relative wind shear 8 however the atmospheric environment leading to their formation is not well understood the moisture profile of the atmosphere particularly the depth of the elevated dry layer also appears to be important 9 and the low-to-mid level shear may also be important 10 this type of supercell may be easily identifiable with sculpted cloud striations in the updraft base or even a corkscrewed or barber pole appearance on the updraft and sometimes an almost anorexic look compared to classic supercells this is because they often form within drier moisture profiles often initiated by dry lines leaving lps with little available moisture despite high mid-to-upper level environmental winds they most often dissipate rather than turning into classic or hp supercells although it is still not unusual for lps to do the latter especially when moving into a much moister air mass lps were first formally described by howard bluestein in the early 1980s 11 although storm chasing scientists noticed them throughout the 1970s 12 classic supercells may wither yet maintain updraft rotation as they decay becoming more like the lp type in a process known as downscale transition that also applies to lp storms and this process is thought to be how many lps dissipate 13 lp supercells rarely spawn tornadoes and those that form tend to be weak small and high based tornadoes but strong tornadoes have been observed these storms although generating lesser precipitation amounts and producing smaller precipitation cores can generate huge hail lps may produce hail larger than baseballs in clear air where no rainfall is visible 14 lps are thus hazardous to people and animals caught outside as well as to storm chasers and spotters due to the lack of a heavy precipitation core lp supercells often exhibit relatively weak radar reflectivity without clear evidence of a hook echo when in fact they are producing a tornado at the time lp supercells may not even be recognized as supercells in reflectivity data unless one is trained or experienced on their radar characteristics 15 this is where observations by storm spotter and storm chasers may be of vital importance in addition to doppler velocity and polarimetric radar data high-based shear funnel clouds sometimes form midway between the base and the top of the storm descending from the main cb cumulonimbus cloud citation needed lightning discharges may be less frequent compared to other supercell types but on occasion lps are prolific sparkers and the discharges are more likely to occur as intracloud lightning rather than cloud-to-ground lightning citation needed in north america these storms most prominently form in the semi-arid great plains during the spring and summer months moving east and southeast they often collide with moist air masses from the gulf of mexico leading to the formation of hp supercells in areas just to the west of interstate 35 before dissipating or coalescing into squall lines at variable distances farther east lp supercells have been observed as far east as illinois and indiana 16 however lp supercells can occur as far north as montana north dakota and even in the prairie provinces of alberta saskatchewan and manitoba in canada they have also been observed by storm chasers in australia and argentina the pampas citation needed lp supercells are quite sought after by storm chasers because the limited amount of precipitation makes sighting tornadoes at a safe distance much less difficult than with a classic or hp supercell and more so because of the unobscured storm structure unveiled during spring and early summer areas in which lp supercells are readily spotted include southwestern oklahoma and northwestern texas among other parts of the western great plains citation needed high precipitation hp edit schematics of an hp supercell high precipitation supercell the hp supercell has a much heavier precipitation core that can wrap all the way around the mesocyclone these are especially dangerous storms since the mesocyclone is wrapped with rain and can hide a tornado if present from view these storms also cause flooding due to heavy rain damaging downbursts and weak tornadoes although they are also known to produce strong to violent tornadoes they have a lower potential for damaging hail than classic and lp supercells although damaging hail is possible it has been observed by some spotters that they tend to produce more cloud-to-ground and intracloud lightning than the other types also unlike the lp and classic types severe events usually occur at the front southeast of the storm the hp supercell is the most common type of supercell in the united states east of interstate 35 in the southern parts of the provinces of ontario and quebec in canada and in the central portions of argentina and uruguay mini-supercell or low-topped supercell edit whereas classic hp and lp refer to different precipitation regimes and mesoscale frontal structures another variation was identified in the early 1990s by jon davies 17 these smaller storms were initially called mini-supercells 18 but are now commonly referred to as low-topped supercells these are also subdivided into classic hp and lp types effects edit satellite view of a supercell supercells can produce large hail damaging winds deadly tornadoes flooding dangerous cloud-to-ground lightning and heavy rain severe events associated with a supercell almost always occur in the area of the updraft downdraft interface in the northern hemisphere this is most often the rear flank southwest side of the precipitation area in lp and classic supercells but sometimes the leading edge southeast side of hp supercells while tornadoes are perhaps the most dramatic of these severe events all are dangerous high winds caused by powerful outflow can reach over 148 km h 92 mph 19 20 and downbursts can cause tornado-like damage flooding is the leading cause of death associated with severe weather 21 note that none of these severe events are exclusive to supercells although these events are highly predictable once a supercell has formed

tornado ripped through brahmanbaria district in bangladesh killing 20 and injuring 200 23 australia edit on april 14 1999 a severe storm later classified as a supercell hit the east coast of new south wales it is estimated that the storm dropped 500,000 tonnes 490,000 long tons 550,000 short tons worth of hailstones during its course at the time it was the most costly disaster in australia s insurance history causing an approximated a 2.3 billion worth of damage of which a 1.7 billion was covered by insurance on february 27 2007 a supercell hit canberra dumping nearly thirty-nine centimetres 15 inches of ice in civic the ice was so heavy that a newly built shopping center s roof collapsed birds were killed in the hail produced from the supercell and people were stranded the following day many homes in canberra were subjected to flash flooding caused either by storm water infrastructure s inability to cope or through mud slides from cleared land 24 on 6 march 2010 supercell storms hit melbourne the storms caused flash flooding in the center of the city and tennis ball-sized 10 cm or 4 in hailstones hit cars and buildings causing more than 220 million worth of

39 south africa edit south africa witnesses several supercell thunderstorms each year with the inclusion of isolated tornadoes on most occasions these tornadoes occur in open farmlands and rarely cause damage to property as such many of the tornadoes which do occur in south africa are not reported the majority of supercells develop in the central northern and north eastern parts of the country the free state gauteng and kwazulu natal are typically the provinces where these storms are most commonly experienced though supercell activity is not limited to these provinces on occasion hail reaches sizes in excess of golf balls and tornadoes though rare also occur on 6 may 2009 a well-defined hook echo was noticed on local south african radars along with satellite imagery this supported

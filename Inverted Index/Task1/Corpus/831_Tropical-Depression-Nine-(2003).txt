usd areas affected lesser antilles puerto rico dominican republic part of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season tropical depression nine was a weak tropical depression that developed and dissipated in the eastern caribbean sea in august 2003 it formed from a tropical wave on august 21 to the south of puerto rico and was initially forecast to strengthen to tropical storm status due to the favorable conditions for development in the area however wind shear developed over the system and the depression degenerated to a tropical wave on august 22 the system produced moderate to heavy rainfall throughout its path in puerto rico the rains flooded ten houses while in the dominican republic the precipitation led to overflown rivers and two injuries meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a strong tropical wave exited the coast of africa on august 14 1 moved westward as a disorganized system and passed through the cape verde islands on august 15 2 on august 17 a weak area of low pressure developed in the system about 750 miles 1,200 km west-southwest of the cape verde islands 3 convection increased over the western portion of the wave axis 4 and the system began to become better organized on august 18 while located about 1,250 miles 2,000 km east of the lesser antilles 5 however convection around the system diminished on august 19 6 and later that day it began to move through the lesser antilles despite favorable upper-level winds and falling atmospheric pressures there were initially no signs of a circulation at the surface 7 convection again increased early on august 20 8 and it gradually became better organized 9 based on a ship s wind report of the system it is estimated the wave developed into tropical depression nine on august 21 while located about 260 miles 415 km south of san juan puerto rico 10 the depression quickly showed signs of organization with the development of banding features around its blossoming convection due to a favorable upper level environment forecasters predicted the depression to intensify to a 70 mph 110 km h tropical storm after making landfall on haiti and eastern cuba 10 upper-level outflow remained well-defined though convection waned near the center early on august 22 11 the depression appeared to continue organizing with a well-defined cloud band to its north and east 12 however strong southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly increased over the system and the depression degenerated into a tropical wave late on august 22 south of the eastern tip of the dominican republic 1 the system retained a well-defined cloud pattern with a vigorous mid-level circulation and forecasters at the national hurricane center indicated regeneration could have occurred at any time 13 the wave axis moved over the dominican republic early on august 23 14 and became disorganized over the mountainous terrain of hispaniola 15 there existed the potential for redevelopment as it moved into a potentially more favorable area 16 though the national hurricane center ceased monitoring the system on august 25 when redevelopment appeared unlikely 17 preparations edit coinciding with the issuance of the first advisory on the tropical depression the government of the dominican republic issued a tropical storm watch from barahona to its border with haiti while a tropical storm watch was issued from haiti s border with the dominican republic westward to port-au-prince the united states national hurricane center in miami recommended interests in eastern cuba to monitor the progress of the storm 18 when the depression was 205 miles 330 km south-southeast of santo domingo the dominican republic issued a tropical storm warning from punta palenque to its border with haiti 19 while located 155 miles 250 km from the coast of hispaniola the government of the dominican republic extended the tropical storm warning eastward to isla saona while the government of haiti upgraded its watch area to a tropical storm warning along the coast the national hurricane center also recommended citizens in the bahamas to monitor the progress of the storm 20 after the heavy rainfall began in the dominican republic officials evacuated citizens of low-lying areas 21 impact edit remnants of tropical depression nine spreading over the greater antilles before developing into tropical depression nine the precursor tropical wave dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the lesser antilles 22 the depression caused moderate rainfall in puerto rico where two to three inches 50 to 75 mm of precipitation were recorded 23 the flooding from the rainfall entered ten houses and left some streets impassable 24 a mudslide was reported in the eastern portion of the island 25 a river in northeastern puerto rico surpassed its banks from flooding though it returned to normal levels within hours 26 damage in puerto rico totaled 20,000 2003 usd 26 thousand 2017 usd 24 the depression dropped over 1 inch 25 mm of precipitation across much of the dominican republic santo domingo reported a peak total of 3.9 in 98 mm the rainfall led to flooding primarily east and west of the capital city while five rivers overflowed their banks several roads were inundated obstructing traffic the flooding collapsed a sports center and a house injuring two people inside further inland 160 people had to be evacuated when more than 100 houses were flooded crop damage was also reported in pedernales gusty winds uprooted trees several of which fell on power lines which caused power outages in the town 27 the rainfall was welcomed in the country as conditions were dry in the preceding months 21 light flooding also occurred in eastern jamaica though damage there if any is unknown 27

colony maryland s first colonial settlement edit main article province of maryland the catholic george calvert 1st lord baltimore 1579–1632 sought a charter from king charles i for the territory between massachusetts to the north and virginia to the immediate south 54 after george calvert died in april 1632 the charter was granted to his son cecilius calvert 2nd baron baltimore 1605–1675 on june 20 1632 officially the new maryland colony was named in honor of henrietta maria of france wife of charles i of england 55 alternatively some catholic scholars and historians believe maryland may have been named after mary the mother of jesus by george calvert 1st lord baltimore prior to his death in 1632 his original intent may never fully be known the specific name given in the charter was phrased terra mariae anglice maryland the english name was preferred due to undesired associations of mariae with the spanish jesuit juan de mariana linked to the inquisition in addition henrietta was never referred to by both her first and middle name scholars also agree that under no circumstances was a territory ever named after someone s middle name many agree who that since the original capital of maryland was st mary s city on the north shore of the potomac river – and the county surrounding it the first erected created in the province 56 was named st mary s county – maryland was most likely named after mary the mother of jesus christ the great seal of maryland also supports this conclusion the obverse side of the seal reads terrÆ mariÆ 57 which translates in latin as land of mary instead of terrÆ maria which would acknowledge henrietta s middle name 58 lord baltimore s first settlers arrived in the new colony in march 1634 with his younger brother leonard calvert 1606–1647 as first provincial governor of maryland they made their first permanent settlement at st mary s city in what is now st mary s county they purchased the site from the paramount chief of the region who was eager to establish trade st mary s became the first capital of maryland and remained so for 60 years until 1695 more settlers soon followed their tobacco crops were successful and quickly made the new colony profitable however given the incidence of malaria yellow fever and typhoid life expectancy in maryland was about 10 years less than in new england 59 persecution of catholics edit see also plundering time maryland was founded for the purpose of providing religious toleration of england s roman catholic minority 60 in 1642 a number of puritans left virginia for maryland and founded providence now called annapolis on the western shore of the upper chesapeake bay 61 a dispute with traders from virginia over kent island in the chesapeake led to armed conflict in 1644 william claiborne a puritan seized kent island while his associate the pro-parliament puritan richard ingle took over st mary s 62 both used religion as a tool to gain popular support the two years from 1644–1646 that claiborne and his puritan associates held sway were known as the plundering time they captured jesuit priests imprisoned them then sent them back to england in 1646 leonard calvert returned with troops recaptured st mary s city and restored order the house of delegates passed the act concerning religion in 1649 granting religious liberty to all trinitarian christians 59 in 1650 the puritans revolted against the proprietary government protestants swept the catholics out of the legislature ..and religious strife returned 59 the puritans set up a new government prohibiting both roman catholicism and anglicanism the puritan revolutionary government persecuted maryland catholics during its reign known as the plundering time mobs burned down all the original catholic churches of southern maryland the puritan rule lasted until 1658 when the calvert family and lord baltimore regained proprietary control and re-enacted the toleration act after england s glorious revolution of 1688 maryland outlawed catholicism this lasted until after the american revolutionary war 1775–1783 wealthy catholic planters built chapels on their land to practice their religion in relative secrecy border disputes 1681–1760 edit main articles penn–calvert boundary dispute and cresap s war the royal charter granted maryland the land north of the potomac river up to the 40th parallel a problem arose when charles ii granted a charter for pennsylvania the grant defined pennsylvania s southern border as identical to maryland s northern border the 40th parallel but the grant indicated that charles ii and william penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to new castle delaware when it falls north of philadelphia the site of which penn had already selected for his colony s capital city negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681 a compromise proposed by charles ii in 1682 was undermined by penn s receiving the additional grant of what is now delaware 63 penn successfully argued that the maryland charter entitled lord baltimore only to unsettled lands and dutch settlement in delaware predated his charter the dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century carried on by the descendants of william penn and lord baltimore — the calvert family which controlled maryland and the penn family which controlled pennsylvania 63 the border dispute with pennsylvania led to cresap s war in the 1730s hostilities erupted in 1730 and escalated through the first half of the decade culminating in the deployment of military forces by maryland in 1736 and by pennsylvania in 1737 the armed phase of the conflict ended in may 1738 with the intervention of king george ii who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire a provisional agreement had been established in 1732 63 negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760 the agreement defined the border between maryland and pennsylvania as the line of latitude now known as the mason–dixon line maryland s border with delaware was based on a transpeninsular line and the twelve-mile circle around new castle 63 18th century edit main article maryland in the american revolution most of the english colonists arrived in maryland as indentured servants and had to serve a several years term as laborers to pay for their passage 64 in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together and formed unions mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem by which children took the social status of their mothers a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies following virginia in 1662 during the colonial era families of free people of color were formed most often by unions of white women and african men 65 comte du bourg left and baron von closen on their way to

university colonial king s college hall 1770 discussions regarding the founding of a college in the province of new york began as early as 1704 at which time colonel lewis morris wrote to the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts the missionary arm of the church of england persuading the society that new york city was an ideal community in which to establish a college 36 however it was not until the founding of the college of new jersey the present princeton university across the hudson river in new jersey that the city of new york seriously consider founding a college 36 in 1746 an act was passed by the general assembly of new york to raise funds for the foundation of a new college in 1751 the assembly appointed a commission of ten new york residents seven of whom were members of the church of england to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college 37 classes were initially held in july 1754 and were presided over by the college s first president dr samuel johnson 38 dr johnson was the only instructor of the college s first class which consisted of a mere eight students instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining trinity church located on what is now lower broadway in manhattan 39 the college was officially founded on october 31 1754 as king s college by royal charter of king george ii making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of new york and the fifth oldest in the united states 20 in 1763 dr johnson was succeeded in the presidency by myles cooper a graduate of the queen s college oxford and an ardent tory in the charged political climate of the american revolution his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777 alexander hamilton 40 the american revolutionary war broke out in 1776 and was catastrophic for the operation of king s college which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the continental army the suspension continued through the military occupation of new york city by british troops until their departure in 1783 the college s library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by american and then british forces 41 42 loyalists were forced to abandon their king s college in new york which was seized by the rebels and renamed columbia college the loyalists led by bishop charles inglis fled to windsor nova scotia where they founded king s collegiate school 43 18th century the gothic revival law school building on the madison avenue campus after the revolution the college turned to the state of new york in order to restore its vitality promising to make whatever changes to the school s charter the state might demand 44 the legislature agreed to assist the college and on may 1 1784 it passed an act for granting certain privileges to the college heretofore called king s college 45 the act created a board of regents to oversee the resuscitation of king s college and in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new republic the legislature stipulated that the college within the city of new york heretofore called king s college be forever hereafter called and known by the name of columbia college 45 a reference to columbia an alternative name for america the regents finally became aware of the college s defective constitution in february 1787 and appointed a revision committee which was headed by john jay and alexander hamilton in april of that same year a new charter was adopted for the college still in use today granting power to a private board of 24 trustees 46 on may 21 1787 william samuel johnson the son of dr samuel johnson was unanimously elected president of columbia college prior to serving at the university johnson had participated in the first continental congress and been chosen as a delegate to the constitutional convention 47 for a period in the 1790s with

revolution 48 the library at columbia university ca 1900 19th century to present low memorial library in november 1813 the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with the college of physicians and surgeons a new school created by the regents of new york forming columbia university college of physicians and surgeons 2 the college s enrollment structure and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned in 1857 the college moved from the king s college campus at park place to a primarily gothic revival campus on 49th street and madison avenue where it remained for the next forty years during the last half of the 19th century under the leadership of president f.a.p barnard the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university 49 by this time the college s investments in new york real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school mainly owing to the city s expanding population 50 university president seth low moved the campus from 49th street to its present location a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of morningside heights 51 under the leadership of low s successor nicholas murray butler who served for over four decades columbia rapidly became the nation s major institution for research setting the

applicants to columbia college 55 the college was closed in 1938 due to the adverse effects of the great depression and its students were subsequently absorbed into university extension 56 in 1947 the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the school of general studies in response to the return of gis after world war ii 57 in 1995 the school of general studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students those who have had an academic break of one year or more or are pursuing dual-degrees and was fully integrated into columbia s traditional undergraduate curriculum 58 within the same year the division of special programs—later the school of continuing education and now the school of professional studies—was established to reprise the former role of university extension 59 while the school of professional studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields 60 alma mater in the aftermath of world war ii the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university and in response the school of international and public affairs was founded in 1946 drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science economics and history 61 during the 1960s columbia experienced large-scale student activism which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus the incident forced the resignation of columbia s president grayson kirk and the establishment of the university senate 62 63 though several schools within the university had admitted women for years columbia college first admitted women in the fall of 1983 after a decade of failed negotiations with barnard college the all-female institution affiliated with the university to merge the two schools

departments ran joint ph.d programs with the university in the disciplines of psychology history and anthropology and all teachers college diplomas were conferred by columbia university 52 teachers college was soon established as the university s faculty of education and department of education 53 during the late 20th century the university underwent significant academic structural and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university for much of the 19th century the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in political science philosophy and pure science in 1979 these faculties were merged into the graduate school of arts and sciences 66 in 1991 the faculties of columbia college the school of general studies the graduate school of arts and sciences the school of the arts and the school of professional studies were merged into the faculty of arts and sciences leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools in 2010 the school of international and public affairs which was previously a part of the faculty of arts and sciences became an independent faculty 67 campus according to

students in 1968 main article columbia university protests of 1968 students initiated a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues the first was columbia s proposed gymnasium in neighboring

institutional membership in the pentagon s weapons research think-tank the institute for defense analyses ida students barricaded themselves inside low library hamilton hall and several other

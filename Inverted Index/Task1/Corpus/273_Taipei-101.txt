elevator in the world traveling at 60.6 km h and transporting passengers from the 5th to 89th floor in 37 seconds 13 in 2016 the title for the fastest elevator was given to the shanghai tower in shanghai china 14 construction on the 101-story tower started in 1999 and finished in 2004 the tower has served as an icon of modern taiwan ever since its opening the building was architecturally created as a symbol of the evolution of technology and asian tradition its postmodernist approach to style incorporates traditional design elements and gives them modern treatments the tower is designed to withstand typhoons and earthquakes a multi-level shopping mall adjoining the tower houses hundreds of stores restaurants and clubs fireworks launched from taipei 101 feature prominently in international new year s eve broadcasts and the structure appears frequently in travel literature and international media taipei 101 is owned by taipei financial center corporation the name that was

highest occupied floor at 439.2 m 1,441 ft surpassed the previous records of 442 m 1,450 ft and 412.4 m 1,353 ft respectively the willis tower had previously held that distinction 3 17 18 19 20 it also surpassed the 85-story 347.5 m 1,140 ft tuntex sky tower in kaohsiung as the tallest building in taiwan and the 51-story 244.15 m 801 ft shin kong life tower as the tallest building in taipei 21 22 taipei 101 claimed the official records for the world s tallest sundial and the world s largest new year s eve countdown clock 23 various sources including the building s owners give the height of taipei 101 as 508 m 1,667 ft roof height and top floor height as 448 m 1,470 ft and 438 m 1,437 ft this lower figure is derived by measuring from the top of a 1.2 m 4 ft platform at the base 1 3 ctbuh standards though include the height of the platform in calculating the overall height as it represents part of the man-made structure and is above the level of the surrounding pavement 17 19 18 20 taipei 101 displaced the petronas towers as the tallest building in the world by 57.3 m 188 ft 19 24 the record it claimed for greatest height from ground to pinnacle was surpassed by the burj khalifa in dubai which is 829.8 m 2,722 ft in height taipei 101 s records for roof height and highest occupied floor briefly passed to the shanghai world financial center in 2008 which in turn yielded these records as well to the burj 17 19 structural design location of taipei 101 s largest tuned mass damper tuned mass damper taipei 101 is designed to withstand the typhoon winds and earthquake tremors that are common in the area east of taiwan evergreen consulting engineering the structural engineer designed taipei 101 to withstand gale winds of 60 metres per second 197 ft s 216 km h or 134 mph as well as the strongest earthquakes in a 2,500-year cycle 25 taipei 101 was designed to be flexible as well as structurally resistant because while flexibility prevents structural damage resistance ensures comfort for the occupants and for the protection of glass curtain walls and other features 26 most designs achieve the necessary strength by enlarging critical structural elements such as bracing because of the height of taipei 101 combined with the surrounding area s geology—the building is located just 660 ft 200 m away from a major fault line 27 —taipei 101 used high-performance steel construction and 36 columns including eight mega-columns packed with 10,000 psi 69 mpa concrete 28 outrigger trusses located at eight-floor intervals connect the columns in the building s core to those on the exterior 29 these features combined with the solidity of its foundation made taipei 101 one of the most stable buildings ever constructed 30 the foundation is reinforced by 380 piles driven 80 m 262 ft into the ground extending as far as 30 m 98 ft into the bedrock each pile is 1.5 m 5 ft in diameter and can bear a load of 1,000–1,320 tonnes 1,100–1,460 short tons 28 during construction on 31 march 2002 a 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked taipei two construction cranes from the 56th floor the highest floor at the time toppled five people died in the accident but an inspection showed no structural damage to the building and construction soon resumed 29 rwdi designed a 660-tonne 728-short-ton 31 32 33 steel pendulum that serves as a tuned mass damper at a cost of nt 132 million us 4 million 34 suspended from the 92nd to the 87th floor the pendulum sways to offset movements in the building caused by strong gusts its sphere the largest damper sphere in the world consists of 41 circular steel plates of varying diameters each 125 mm 4.92 in thick welded together to form a 5.5 m 18 ft diameter sphere two additional tuned mass dampers each weighing 6 tonnes 7 short tons are installed at the tip of the spire which help prevent damage to the structure due to strong wind loads 34 35 on 8 august 2015 strong winds from typhoon soudelor swayed the main damper by 100 centimetres 39 in  – the largest movement ever recorded by the damper 36 the damper has become such a popular tourist attraction the city contracted sanrio to create a mascot the damper baby four versions of the damper baby rich gold cool black smart silver and lucky red were designed and made into figurines and souvenirs sold in various taipei 101 gift shops damper baby with its cute all-ages appeal has become a popular local icon with its own comic book and website 37 38 39 structural façade taipei 101 during a typhoon view from the base of the tower looking up ruyi figure over one of the building s entrances shadow of the tower in the late afternoon the adjoining park circular feature bottom acts as the face of a sundial feng shui fountain outside taipei 101 taipei 101 s characteristic blue-green glass curtain walls are double paned and glazed offer heat and uv protection sufficient to block external heat by 50 percent and can sustain impacts of 7 tonnes 8 short tons 25 the façade system of glass and aluminum panels installed into an inclined moment-resisting lattices contributes to overall lateral rigidity by tying back to the mega-columns with one-story high trusses at every eighth floor this façade system is therefore able to withstand up to 95 mm 4 in of seismic lateral displacements without damage 40 the original corners of the façade were tested at rwdi in ontario a simulation of a 100-year storm at rwdi revealed a vortex that formed during a 3-second 105 miles per hour 169 km h wind at a height of 10 meters or equivalent to the lateral tower sway rate causing large crosswind oscillations a double chamfered step design was found to dramatically reduce this crosswind oscillation resulting in the final design s double stairstep corner façade 41 architect c.y lee also used extensive façade elements to represent the symbolic identity he pursued these façade elements included the green tinted glass for the indigenous slender bamboo look eight upper outwards inclined tiers of pagoda each with eight floors a ruyi and a money box symbol between the two façade sections among others 42 taipei 101 s own roof and façade recycled water system meets 20 to 30 percent of the building s water needs in july 2011 taipei 101 was certified the world s tallest green building under leed standards 43 symbolism taipei 101 in the skyline the height of 101 floors commemorates the renewal of time the new century that arrived as the tower was built 100 1 and all the new years that follow 1 january 1-01 it symbolizes high ideals by going one better on 100 a traditional number of perfection the number also evokes the binary numeral system used in digital technology 28 the main tower features a series of eight segments of eight floors each in chinese-speaking cultures the number eight is associated with abundance prosperity and good fortune 44 45 the repeated segments simultaneously recall the rhythms of an asian pagoda a tower linking earth and sky also evoked in the petronas towers a stalk of bamboo an icon of learning and growth and a stack of ancient chinese ingots or money boxes a symbol of abundance popular humor sometimes likens the building s shape to a stack of take-out boxes as used in western-style chinese food of course the stackable shape of such boxes is likewise derived from that of ancient money boxes 46 the four discs mounted on each face of the building where the pedestal meets the tower represent coins the emblem placed over entrances shows three gold coins of ancient design with central holes shaped to imply the arabic numerals 1-0-1 28 the structure incorporates many shapes of squares and circles to reach a balance between yin and yang curled ruyi figures appear throughout the structure as a design motif though the shape of each ruyi at taipei 101 is traditional its rendering in industrial metal is plainly modern the ruyi is a talisman of ancient origin associated in art with heavenly clouds it connotes healing protection and fulfillment it appears in celebrations of the attainment of new career heights 47 48 the sweeping curved roof of the adjoining mall culminates in a colossal ruyi that shades pedestrians 48 each ruyi ornament on the exterior of the taipei 101 tower stands at least 8 m 26 ft tall 49 at night the bright yellow gleam from its pinnacle casts taipei 101 in the role of a candle or torch upholding the ideals of liberty and welcome from 6 00 to 10 00 each evening 50 the tower s lights display one of seven colours in the spectrum the colors coincide with the days of the week 51 day monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday color red orange yellow green blue violet purple the adjoining taipei 101 on the east side connects the landmark further with the symbolism of time the design of the circular park doubles as the face of a giant sundial the tower itself casts the shadow to mark afternoon hours for the building s occupants the park s design is echoed in a clock that stands at its entrance the clock runs on energy drawn from the building s wind shear 52 taipei 101 like many of its neighbours shows the influence of feng shui philosophy an example appears in the form of a large granite fountain at the intersection of songlian road and xinyi road near the tower s east entrance 53 a ball at the fountain s top spins toward the tower as a work of public art the fountain offers a contrast to the tower in texture even as its design echoes the tower s rhythms the fountain also serves a practical function in feng shui philosophy a t intersection near the entrance of a building represents a potential drain of positive energy or ch i from a structure and its occupants 54 55 placing flowing water at such spots is thought to help redirect the flow of ch i 56 57 interior taipei 101 is the first record-setting skyscraper to be constructed in the 21st century it exhibits a number of technologically advanced features as it provides a center for business and recreation 3 the original 2004 fiber-optic and satellite internet connections permitted transfer speeds up to a gigabit per second 26 the double-deck elevators built by the japanese toshiba elevator and building systems corporation telc set a new record in 2004 with the fastest ascending speeds in the world at 60.6 kilometres 37.7 mi per hour

establishments and retail outlets also operate in the adjoining mall the multi-story retail mall adjoining the tower is home to hundreds of fashionable stores restaurants clubs and other attractions the mall s interior is modern in design even as it makes use of traditional elements the curled ruyi symbol is a recurring motif inside the mall many features of the interior also observe feng shui traditions 57 floor directory the 101st floor is home to a private vip club named summit 101 according to the observatory brochure before 2014 no information about this club was ever made public 66 in

still incomplete the height of the building was still 449.2 meters at the time planning for taipei 101 began in july 1997 2 during chen shui-bian s term as taipei mayor talks between merchants and city government officials initially centered on a proposal for a 66-story tower to serve as an anchor for new development in taipei s 101 business district planners were considering taking the new structure to a more ambitious height only after an expat suggested it along with many of the other features used in the design of the building it wasn t until the summer of 2001 that the city granted a license for the construction of a 101-story tower on the site in the meantime construction proceeded and the first tower column was erected in the summer of 2000 2 64 a major earthquake took place

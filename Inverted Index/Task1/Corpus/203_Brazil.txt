interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer pedro Álvares cabral who claimed the area for the portuguese empire brazil remained a portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred from lisbon to rio de janeiro in 1815 the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the empire of brazil a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system the ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature now called the national congress the country

coffee for the last 150 years 24 etymology main article name of brazil it is likely that the word brazil comes from the portuguese word for brazilwood a tree that once grew plentifully along the brazilian coast 25 in portuguese brazilwood is called pau-brasil with the word brasil commonly given the etymology red like an ember formed from latin brasa ember and the suffix il from iculum or ilium 26 as brazilwood produces a deep red dye it was highly valued by the european cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from brazil 27 throughout the 16th century massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples mostly tupi along the brazilian coast who sold the timber to european traders mostly portuguese but also french in return for assorted european consumer goods 28 the official portuguese name of the land in original portuguese records was the land of the holy cross terra da santa cruz 29 but european sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the land of brazil terra do brasil on account of the brazilwood trade 30 the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name some early sailors called it the land of parrots 31 in the guarani language an official language of paraguay brazil is called pindorama this was the name the indigenous population gave to the region meaning land of the palm trees 32 history main articles history of brazil and timeline of brazilian history pre-cabraline era main article history of brazil § precolonial history megaliths in the solstice archaeological park in amapá erected between 500 and 2000 years ago probably to carry out astronomical observations some of the earliest human remains found in the americas luzia woman were found in the area of pedro leopoldo minas gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years 33 34 the earliest pottery ever found in the western hemisphere was excavated in the amazon basin of brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago 6000 bc the pottery was found near santarém and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture 35 around the time of the portuguese arrival the territory of current day brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people 36 mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting fishing gathering and migrant agriculture the indigenous population of brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups e.g the tupis guaranis gês and arawaks the tupí people were subdivided into the tupiniquins and tupinambás and there were also many subdivisions of the other groups 37 before the arrival of the europeans the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture language and moral beliefs 38 these wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war 39 40 while heredity had some weight leadership status was more subdued over time than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions 38 slavery among the indians had a different meaning than it had for europeans since it originated from a diverse socio-economic organization in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations 41 portuguese colonization main article colonial brazil representation of the landing of pedro Álvares cabral in porto seguro 1500 the land now called brazil was claimed for the portuguese empire on 22 april 1500 with the arrival of the portuguese fleet commanded by pedro Álvares cabral 42 the portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes most of whom spoke languages of the tupi–guarani family and fought among themselves 43 though the first settlement was founded in 1532 colonization effectively began in 1534 when king dom joão iii of portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincy colonies of brazil 44 45 however the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic and in 1549 the portuguese king restructured them into the governorate general of brazil a single and centralized portuguese colony in south america 45 46 in the first two centuries of colonization indigenous and european groups lived in constant war establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other 47 48 49 50 by the mid-16th century cane sugar had become brazil s most important exportation product 43 51 and slaves purchased in sub-saharan africa in the slave market of western africa 52 not only those from portuguese allies of their colonies in angola and mozambique had become its largest import 53 54 to cope with plantations of sugarcane due to increasing international demand for brazilian sugar 55 56 painting showing the arrest of tiradentes he was sentenced to death for his involvement in the best known movement for independence in colonial brazil by the end of the 17th century sugarcane exports began to decline 57 and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony s economy fostering a brazilian gold rush 58 which attracted thousands of new settlers to brazil from portugal and all portuguese colonies around the world 59 this increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers 60 portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually advanced the portugal colonial original frontiers in south america to approximately the current brazilian borders 61 62 in this era other european powers tried to colonize parts of brazil in incursions that the portuguese had to fight notably the french in rio during the 1560s in maranhão during the 1610s and the dutch in bahia and pernambuco during the dutch–portuguese war after the end of iberian union 63 the portuguese colonial administration in brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of portugal s wealthiest and largest colony to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance such as the quilombo of palmares 64 and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence such as the minas conspiracy 65 united kingdom with portugal main article united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves the acclamation of king joão vi of the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves in rio de janeiro 6 february 1818 in late 1807 spanish and napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental portugal causing prince regent joão in the name of queen maria i to move the royal court from lisbon to brazil 66 there they established some of brazil s first financial institutions such as its local stock exchanges 67 and its national bank additionally ending the portuguese monopoly on brazilian trade and opening brazil to other nations in 1809 in retaliation for being forced into exile the prince regent ordered the portuguese conquest of french guiana 68 with the end of the peninsular war in 1814 the courts of europe demanded that queen maria i and prince regent joão return to portugal deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient european monarchy to reside in a colony in 1815 in order to justify continuing to live in brazil where the royal court had thrived for the past six years the crown established the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state 69 however such a ploy didn t last long since the leadership in portugal resentful of the new status of its larger colony continued to require the return of court to lisbon as postulated by the liberal revolution of 1820 and also groups of brazilians impatient for practical and real changes still demanded independence and a republic as demonstrated by the 1817 pernambucan revolt 69 in 1821 as a demand of revolutionaries who had taken the city of porto 70 d joão vi was unable to hold out any longer and departed for lisbon there he swore oath to the new constitution leaving his son prince pedro de alcântara as regent of the kingdom of brazil 71 independent empire main articles independence of brazil and empire of brazil declaration of the brazilian independence by prince pedro later emperor pedro i on 7 september 1822 tensions between portuguese and brazilians increased and the portuguese cortes guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 liberal revolution tried to re-establish brazil as a colony 72 the brazilians refused to yield and prince pedro decided to stand with them declaring the country s independence from portugal on 7 september 1822 73 a month later prince pedro was declared the first emperor of brazil with the royal title of dom pedro i resulting in the foundation of the empire of brazil 74 the brazilian war of independence which had already begun along this process spread through northern northeastern regions and in cisplatina province 75 with the last portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 march 1824 76 portugal officially recognized brazil on 29 august 1825 77 on 7 april 1831 worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissensions with both liberal and conservative sides of politics including an attempt of republican secession 78 as well as unreconciled with the way that absolutists in portugal had given to the succession of king john vi pedro i went to portugal to reclaim his daughter s crown abdicating the brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir who thus became the empire s second monarch with the royal title of dom pedro ii 79 pedro ii emperor of brazil between 1831 and 1889 as the new emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age a regency was set up by the national assembly 80 in the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power during this period a series of localized rebellions took place as the cabanagem the malê revolt the balaiada the sabinada and the ragamuffin war which emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar of a vast slaveholding and newly independent nation state 81 this period of internal political and social upheaval which included the praieira revolt was overcome only at the end of the 1840s years after the end of the regency which occurred with the premature coronation of pedro ii in 1841 82 during the last phase of the monarchy internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery the atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850 83 as a result of the british aberdeen act but only in may 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country was the institution formally abolished 84 the foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the southern cone with which brazil has borders long after the cisplatine war that resulted in independence for uruguay 85 brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of pedro ii these were the platine war the uruguayan war and the devastating paraguayan war the largest war effort in brazilian history 86 87 on 15 november 1889 worn out by years of economic stagnation in attrition with the majority of army officers as well as with rural and financial elites for different reasons the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup 88 early republic main articles first brazilian republic estado novo brazil and second brazilian republic proclamation of the republic 1893 oil on canvas by benedito calixto 1853–1927 the early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship with army dominating affairs both at rio de janeiro and in the states freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power 89 in 1894 following the unfoldings of two severe crises an economic along with a military one the republican civilians rose to power 90 91 92 if in relation to its foreign policy the country in this first republican period maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries 93 only broken by the acre war 1899–1902 and its involvement in world war i 1914–1918 94 95 96 followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the league of nations 97 internally from the crisis of encilhamento 98 99 100 and the armada revolts 101 a prolonged cycle of financial political and social instability began until the 1920s keeping the country besieged by various rebellions both civilian 102 103 104 and military 105 106 107 little by little a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate the defeated opposition presidential candidate getúlio vargas supported by most of the military successfully led the october 1930 s coup 108 109 vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily but instead closed the congress extinguished the constitution ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states governors with their own supporters 110 111 in half of the first 100 years of republic the army exercised power directly or through

the constitution of 1988 in his hands in the 1930s three failed attempts to remove vargas and his supporters from power occurred the first was the constitutionalist revolt in 1932 led by the paulista oligarchy the second was a communist uprising in november 1935 and the last one a putsch attempt by the local fascists in may 1938 112 113 114 the 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which the congress transferred more power to the executive the 1937 coup d état resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election installed vargas as a dictator and began the estado novo era noted for government brutality and censorship of the press 115 the foreign policy during vargas years was marked by the antecedents and occurrence of world war ii having brazil remained neutral until august 1942 when the country entered on the allied side 116 117 after suffering retaliations undertaken by nazi germany and fascist italy in the context of the strategic dispute over the south atlantic 118 in addition to its participation in the battle of the atlantic brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the italian campaign 119 with the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the nazi-fascist regimes in europe vargas s position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup with democracy being reinstated by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years earlier 120 vargas committed suicide in august 1954 amid a political crisis after having returned to power by election in 1950 121 122 contemporary era main articles brazilian military government and history of brazil since 1985 several brief interim governments followed vargas s suicide 123 juscelino kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises 124 the economy and industrial sector grew remarkably 125 but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of brasília inaugurated in 1960 126 his successor jânio quadros resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office 127 his vice-president joão goulart assumed the presidency but aroused strong political opposition 128 and was deposed in april 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military regime 129 the new regime was intended to be transitory 130 but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the fifth institutional act in 1968 131 oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime but also reached institutional opponents artists journalists and other members of civil society 132 133 inside and outside the country through the infamous operation condor 134 135 despite its brutality like other totalitarian regimes due to an economic boom known as an economic miracle the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s 136 slowly however the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas 137 plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made an opening policy inevitable which from the regime side was led by generals geisel and golbery 138 with the enactment of the amnesty law in 1979 brazil began its slow return to democracy which was completed during the 1980s 82 civilians returned to power in 1985 when josé sarney assumed the presidency becoming unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime 139 sarney s unsuccessful government led to the election in 1989 of the almost-unknown fernando collor subsequently impeached by the national congress in 1992 140 collor was succeeded by his vice-president itamar franco who appointed fernando henrique cardoso minister of finance in 1994 cardoso produced a highly successful plano real 141 that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation finally granted stability to the brazilian economy 142 143 leading cardoso to be elected that year and again in 1998 144 the peaceful transition of power from cardoso to his main opposition leader luiz inácio lula da silva elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006 was seen as proof that brazil had finally succeeded in achieving a long-sought political stability 145 146 however sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades from corruption police brutality inefficiencies of the political establishment and public service numerous peaceful protests erupted in brazil from the middle of first term of dilma rousseff who succeeded lula in the in 2010 147 148 enhanced by a political and

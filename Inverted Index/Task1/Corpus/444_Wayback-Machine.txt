not include all the information available on the internet since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible to overcome inconsistencies in partially

would be crawled or not or if already crawled if its archives would be publicly viewable website owners had the option to opt-out of wayback machine through the use of robots.txt it applied robots.txt rules retroactively if a site blocked the internet archive any previously archived pages from the domain were immediately rendered unavailable as well in addition the internet archive stated sometimes

preserving or offering access to web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection 38 oakland archive policy edit wayback s retroactive exclusion policy is based in part upon recommendations for managing removal requests and preserving archival integrity published by the school of information management and systems at university of california

litigation edit netbula llc v chordiant software inc edit in a 2009 case netbula llc v chordiant software inc. defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the robots.txt file on its website that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from netbula s site pages that chordiant believed would support its case 50 netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter netbula s website and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly 51 an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting chordiant s motion however stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means without considerable burden expense and disruption to its operations 50 magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california san jose division rejected netbula s arguments and ordered them to disable the robots.txt blockage temporarily in

673 n.d ill oct 15 2004 a litigant attempted to use the wayback machine archives as a source of admissible evidence perhaps for the first time telewizja polska is the provider of tvp polonia and echostar operates the dish network prior to the trial proceedings echostar indicated that it intended to offer wayback machine snapshots as proof of the past content of telewizja polska s website telewizja polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source but magistrate judge arlander keys rejected telewizja polska s assertion of hearsay and denied tvp s motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial 52 53 at the trial however district court judge ronald guzman the trial judge overruled magistrate keys findings citation

employee s affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements and the purported web page printouts were not self-authenticating citation needed patent law edit main article internet as a source of prior art provided some additional requirements are met e.g. providing an authoritative statement of the archivist the united states patent office and the european patent office will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application 54 limitations of utility edit there are technical limitations to archiving a website and as a consequence it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by website archives this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints answers or expert witness reports when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore can contain errors for example archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore do not include the contents of non-restful e-commerce databases in their archives 55 legal status edit in europe the wayback machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated so the archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator 56 the exclusion policies for the wayback machine may be found in the faq section of the

healthcare advocates inc edit in 2003 harding earley follmer frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the archive s wayback machine the attorneys were able to demonstrate that the

accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the dmca and the computer fraud and abuse act healthcare advocates claimed that since they had installed a robots.txt file on their website even if after the initial lawsuit was filed the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the wayback machine however some material continued to be publicly visible on wayback 60 the lawsuit was settled out of court after wayback fixed the problem 61 suzanne shell edit in december 2005 activist suzanne shell filed suit demanding internet archive pay her us 100,000 for archiving her website profane-justice.org between 1999 and 2004 62 63 internet archive filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of california on january 20 2006 seeking a judicial determination that internet archive did not violate shell s copyright shell responded and brought a countersuit against internet archive

of persons who do not wish to have their web content archived we recognize that ms shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her web site and we regret that the inclusion of her web site in the

deeply value individual privacy we also strongly oppose censorship 45 there are known rare cases where online access to content which for nothing has put people in danger was disabled 45 other threats include natural disasters 75 destruction remote or physical citation needed manipulation of the archive s contents see also cyberattack backup problematic copyright laws 76 and surveillance of the site s users 77 kevin vaughan suspects that in the long-term of multiple generations next to nothing will survive in a useful way besides if we have continuity in our technological civilization by which a lot of the bare data will remain findable and searchable 78 some find the internet archive which describes itself to be built for the long-term, 79 to be working furiously to capture data before it disappears without any long-term infrastructure to speak of 80 copyright violation

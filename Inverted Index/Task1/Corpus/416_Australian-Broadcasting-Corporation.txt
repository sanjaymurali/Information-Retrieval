by radio licence fees amendments were also made to the australian broadcasting act that meant the abc would receive its funding directly from the federal government licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the whitlam labor government on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for

commitment to fundamental democratic principles — abc editorial policy criticisms edit as a publicly funded broadcaster the abc is expected not to take editorial stances on political issues and is required to present a range of views with impartiality over the decades accusations of bias at the abc have arisen at different times and various inquiries undertaken reviews of the abc are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released 75 76 a 2004 roy morgan media credibility survey found that media professionals regarded abc radio as the most accurate news source in the country 77 in mid 2013 the university of the sunshine coast released a study of the professional views of journalists slightly over half of respondents expected to vote for either labor or the greens whereas just under a third planned to vote coalition in contrast over 40 of abc journalists would vote for the greens and almost a third labor 78 79 dr rhonda jolly s 2014 abc overview noted that many commentators have argued consistently that there is a left wing bias which dominates abc news and programming and cited a 2005 piece by paul gray that the broadcaster was overly influenced by the narrow middle-class values of the australian secular left and said that while the national broadcaster had at times offended governments of all persuasions it had always adopted a from the left perspective jolly also noted however that supporters of the abc deny claims that the broadcaster is either intentionally or inadvertently biased and that speaking from opposition politicians have praised the abc for its scrutiny of government the paper noted that in december 2013 abc chairman james spigelman called four independent audits a year in response to the frequent allegations of lack of impartiality in news and current affairs 80 in response to one set of criticisms journalist annabel crabb who has worked at the abc commented every single day i see that organisation give voices to australians who otherwise wouldn t be heard on topics that are too uncommercial or too remote or too hard to be covered by anyone else broadcasting into areas from which others have long withdrawn resources 81 1960s

disgraceful 84 howard government edit during the howard government years abc tv s masthead political programs were anchored by labor affiliated journalists lateline host maxine mckew pictured ran for labor against liberal prime minister john howard in the 2007 election for much of the howard government years abc tv s masthead political programs were anchored by labor affiliated journalists kerry o brien barrie cassidy and maxine mckew 7.30 report and insiders were hosted by former labor staffers kerry o brien and barrie cassidy respectively while the 2007 election saw lateline host mckew defeat

turned labor candidate mike bailey in the seat of north sydney 85 of the 1996 prime ministerial election debates between opposition leader john howard and labor prime minister paul keating howard later wrote i flatly refused to have kerry o brien of the abc moderate the debates because of the way he had handled the second keating-hewson debate in 1993 in which o brien went in to bat for keating 86 howard went on to win that election a decade later the abc media watch program reported that nsw liberal senator concetta fierravanti-wells had written to her constituents to say that the abc had a collective loathing of john howard 87 at the end of the howard government s term in 2007 left-wing political commentator robert manne wrote in the monthly that the howard government had viewed the broadcaster as being run by left-wing ideologues who had supposedly pushed the agenda of the left on issues like refugees the republic multiculturalism reconciliation radical feminism extreme environmentalism anti-americanism gay rights and so on 3 soon after coming to office in 1996 the howard government reduced the abc s operating grants by 10 88 its appointment of jonathan shier to the position of managing director was controversial for his program of budget cuts restructuring and the loss of several high-profile personalities and shows 89 90 shier left the position early on 31 october 2001 91 7.30 report anchor kerry o brien opposed howard s budget cuts to the abc and describes the appointment of shier as its managing director as a manifestation of the conservative obsession with the abc as a kind of biased left-wing culture 92 in howard s last election he was defeated in the seat of bennelong by labor candidate maxine mckew who had hosted lateline during the howard era 93 peter mares reported for radio national that some wags described it as an internal promotion while others said she d simply moved from the media wing to the political wing of the alp mares consulted abc journalist turned nsw liberal mla pru goward who said i have no doubt there was left-wing bias i certainly thought it when i was there while mckew said there was no left wing bias though what i detected years ago in the abc much more of a collectivist philosophy 94 rudd-gillard-rudd government 2007-2013 edit abc tv s masthead political programs continued to have strong labor party connections through the period in october 2010 the abc announced that former labor staffer kerry o brien would host four corners beginning in 2011 95 96 former labor staffer barrie cassidy

juanita phillips began a relationship with labor s minister for climate change greg combet 98 99 100 101 conservative commentators such as andrew bolt 102 tim blair and gerard henderson 102 accused the abc of a left-wing bias abbott-turnbull government 2013-present edit liberal prime minister tony abbott perceived the abc to be left wing and hostile to his government while his successor malcolm turnbull enjoyed better relations with the national broadcaster when the abc co-operated with the guardian to publish stolen documents purporting to reveal monitoring of indonesian officials by australian spy agencies under the rudd government abbott told 2gb radio a lot of people feel at the moment that the abc instinctively takes everyone s side but australia s 103 104 105 abbott reportedly called the q a program a lefty lynch mob 106 when it invited a man convicted of threatening commonwealth officials to participate in questioning one of his ministers amid a heightened terrorism alert in june 2015 abbott asked the makers of the program whose side are you on 107 108 the abc found that there had been an error of judgement but repeated the program later in the week prompting abbott to say that heads should roll over the affair 109 abbott initiated a brief ministerial boycott of the q a program following the affair 110 the broadcaster was critical of abbott when he broke an election-eve promise not to make cuts to the abc and required 4.6 cuts over five years as part of his budget repair program 111 112 in early 2015 an internal abc review of its coverage of joe hockey s first budget criticised the post-budget interviews by 7 30 and lateline finding that the interviewers had given the impression of bias 113 when abbott lost the leadership to turnbull in

weekly current affairs programs four corners and insiders welcomed the replacement of abbott by turnbull 114 115 as did abc radio commentators fran kelly 116 paul bongiorno 117 and amanda vanstone 118 fairfax and news limited reported that leigh sales the host of 7.30 gave turnbull an unusually warm first interview following his toppling of abbott 119 120 in a march 2016 interview with abc managing director mark scott media watch host paul barry examined the question of perceptions of left wing bias at the abc scott noted that while perhaps the abc was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices he did not accept the criticism of bias because a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the abc we don’t do that kind of journalism we don’t ask questions about our journalists’ voting pattern and where their ideology are we look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards.. 121 following the interview conservative abc critic andrew bolt wrote how can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the abc s unlawful and dangerous leftist bias while former media watch host jonathan holmes wrote for the age that this interview indicated that abc management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters 122 over the period abc tv and radio hosts advocated strongly in support of same-sex marriage upon which the wider australian community and political parties were divided when the turnbull government announced plans for a postal plebiscite on the issue advocacy for change continued prompting a call for restraint from the abc s editorial policy manager mark maley 123 an interview by abc presenter joe o brien with lyle shelton was the subject of a complaint by the australian christian lobby bringing up ian thorpe s swimming achievements o brien asked shelton what right do you have to participate in that joy and take national pride in those achievements if you now deny him the right to feel like an equal and experience the joy of marriage 124 in rejecting any perceived bias the abc said it was a devil s advocate question and not inconsistent with standards 125 abc journalists in politics edit a number of former journalists and presenters have moved from

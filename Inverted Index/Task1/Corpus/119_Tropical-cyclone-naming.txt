and subtropical cyclones are named by various warning centers to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts watches and warnings the names are intended to reduce confusion in the event of concurrent storms in the same basin generally once storms produce sustained wind speeds of more than 33 knots 61 km h 38 mph names are assigned in order from predetermined lists depending on which basin they originate however standards vary from basin to basin some tropical depressions are named in the western pacific while tropical cyclones must have a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the centre before they are named in the southern hemisphere before the formal start of naming tropical cyclones were named after places objects or saints feast days on which they occurred the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907 this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of world war ii for the western pacific formal naming schemes and naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the eastern central western and southern pacific basins as well as the australian

the western pacific 8 formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the north atlantic eastern central western and southern pacific basins as well as the australian region and indian ocean 8 at present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven warning centers and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to facilitate the effective communication of forecasts and storm-related hazards to the general public 9 this is especially important when multiple storms are occurring simultaneously in the same ocean basin 9 names are generally assigned in order from predetermined lists once they produce one three or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65 km h 40 mph 1 4 5 however standards vary from basin to basin with some systems named in the western pacific when they develop into tropical depressions or enter pagasa s area of responsibility 3 within the southern hemisphere systems must be characterized by a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the center before they are named 5 6 any member of the world meteorological organization s hurricane typhoon and tropical cyclone committees can request that the name of a tropical cyclone be retired or withdrawn from the various tropical cyclone naming lists 1 2 6 a name is retired or withdrawn if a consensus or majority of members agree that the system has acquired a special notoriety such as causing a large number of deaths and amounts of damage impact or for other special reasons 1 a replacement name is then submitted to the committee concerned and voted upon but these names can be rejected and replaced with another name for various reasons 1 2 these reasons include the spelling and pronunciation of the name the similarity to the name of a recent tropical cyclone or on another list of names and the length of the name for modern communication channels such as social media 1 10 pagasa also retires the names of significant tropical cyclones when they have caused at

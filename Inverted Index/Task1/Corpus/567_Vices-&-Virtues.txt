studio album by american rock band panic at the disco released on march 22 2011 on fueled by ramen produced by john feldmann and butch walker the album was recorded as a duo by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist brendon urie and drummer spencer smith following the departure of lead guitarist backing vocalist and primary lyricist ryan ross and bassist backing vocalist jon walker in july 2009 the album s artwork was conceptualized by touring bassist dallon weekes who was inducted as a full-time member of the band near the end of recording 2 while walker and ross exit left a hole in the panic songwriting regime the experience became the catalyst for urie finding his own voice and the confidence to take over as the band s principal songsmith the lyrics touch on themes of manipulation and confusion vices virtues took over two years to create and the increased time in the studio brought forth new musical experimentation upon release the album received generally mixed to positive reviews critics praised the album s wide variety of musical stylings while citing compositional simplicity and urie s verbose lyricism as detractors preceded by lead single the ballad of mona lisa the album debuted at number seven on the billboard 200 selling 56,000 copies within its first week background edit material for a follow-up to pretty odd dates back to at least april 2008 just one month after the release of the record former guitarist and primary songwriter ryan ross told nme the band had nine or ten new songs going right now which picked up in the same direction of pretty odd 3 it was pretty much the same with the last record bassist jon walker said we haven t stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd. because we have a lot to write about . it s sounding pretty awesome which is probably what we re going to call the next record ross joked 4 we ve got quite a few new ideas and songs we ve been working on and we re hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year 4 the article explained that walker said the band would be taking time off for the holidays and then re-entering the studio to record new music 4 in june 2009 singer brendon urie revealed the band had been writing for roughly half a year now at ross topanga canyon california home and continued to take the band further down the sun-dappled retro-pop path they began exploring on pretty odd we ve always been a pop band we ve always been fans of pop music whether it s the beatles – which is like the beginning of pop music – we ve always been fans of good catchy melodies and lighthearted music spencer smith drummer added we moved to california since the last record so that s inspiration we started surfing too so maybe we ll get a little beach boys vibe on this one 5 during this time smith moved in with urie while ross began writing his own material with walker at his home 6 on july 6 2009 ryan ross and jon walker announced via the band s official website that the two were leaving the band 7 8 the statement in part read ryan ross and jon walker will be leaving panic at the disco to embark on a musical excursion of their own though the four of us have made music together in the past we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve over the years we have remained close and honest with each other which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us 8 in an interview following the split ross explained that he first brought the idea to smith in late june 2009 over lunch spencer and i had lunch and caught up for a while and then the big question came up like well what do you want to do and i said well i think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while and he said i m glad you said that because i was going to say the same thing ross recalled and there was really no argument which is really the best way that could ve worked out ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and urie urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound while ross — and by extension walker — was interested in making retro-inspired rock 9 the news asserted that both tour plans with blink-182 in august 2009 and new album production will continue as previously announced 7 and the announcement ended with the teaser for a surprise soon to come 8 the following day alternative press broke the news that new perspective the first song recorded without ross and walker debuted the following month on radio and as a part of the soundtrack to the film jennifer s body 10 new perspective was recorded in spring 2009 when the band had just moved out to topanga smith explained the song was inspired by the band s new experiences when there we re living near the ocean and going surfing every day which we ve never done before we tried to get that out in the song i guess 11 the band reinserted the exclamation mark into its name a few days after the departure of ross and walker 12 recording and production edit the writing and recording process for vices virtues took much longer than the band intended the band was very confused after the split from ross and walker desiring instead to go on tour to understand better 13 as evidenced above oh glory and new perspective were largely recorded during the summer of 2009 with producer john feldmann 6 these songs are just brendon and i having fun because that s what we want to do smith told mtv news 6 shortly after the departure of ross and walker smith revealed the band was recording we re working on an album now that hopefully takes the best parts from both of our records . because we love them both and are really proud of them 14 while on the blink-182 reunion tour smith showed blink-182 singer bassist mark hoppus several demos for the album in hopes that he would produce a song or two 6 hoppus confirmed in august 2009 that he was committed to producing one really strong track on the record as well as possible others if allowed 15 during this time urie told news outlets the band had about 10 songs ready to consider for the band s third album 16 in the beginning stages a song featuring rivers cuomo of weezer whom urie later described as super nice was set to appear on the new album but the song is absent from the final track listing 17 the band initially planned to record the album in fall 2009 to be released the beginning of 2010 16 however recording did not begin until april 2010 friend and pretty odd producer rob mathes was like family to smith and urie inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo s initial beginning he encouraged them to love the work they do and . just get out of bed in the morning don’t loathe the things that you actually love doing because it’s just going to keep you down for which urie recalled the band owed a lot for 13 after working with the demos produced during the summer with feldmann for several months afterward the duo decided they weren t satisfactory so the band started over with new material the biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band with urie and smith writing everything 13 the album was produced by feldmann and butch walker 18 urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers but instead regarded feldmann and walker s input positively regarding their help as hey this is your record i want to help you with your ideas so you bring me the ideas and we’ll help you do that i don’t want to write anything for you this is your record it has to be your voice the band continued working with feldmann for four months in early 2010 later going to walker to finalize and improve the songs 13 on may 7 2010 the band posted a batch of photos during recording sessions for vices virtues 19 all guitars and bass for the album were completed by early july 20 and by the end of the month urie confirmed that recording of the album was complete and mixing would follow soon 21 near the end of the writing process the band looked back upon the lyrics and noticed that some of the motion was pining for something or some of it was vanity or some of it touched on subversion or overthrowing of somebody or manipulation urie likened it to the seven deadly sins and after research settled on the title vices virtues in the biblical sense there s all that stuff and then there’s just morals that we live by every day and human behavior urie said i guess this record was really a study in human behavior—mostly for us personally what we had been going through and noticing all of that 13 music edit the duo performing on the first show of the vices virtues tour in new york city february 1 2011 musically vices virtues has been described as alternative rock 22 pop rock 23 24 25 pop punk 23 26 27 emo pop 28 29 baroque pop 30 31 and synth-pop 32 the album features a variety of different musical styles in its tracks as a testament to the amount of time of production each song sounds different from the next according to urie in the beginning the band had no direction for music or lyrics however after returning to the studio and restarting production the band became excited to start with a second chance we ve been working on music for about a year and a half so i think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles smith said part of it was us at the beginning trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was just kind of went from there 33 the duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was ..you get all the work done record the song arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before 13 the band s musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an ipad to record synthesizers on the record the band got to work with french band the plastiscines and a children s choir on the track nearly witches ever since we met.. 34 a majority of the band s previous material was written by former guitarist ryan ross for vices virtues urie had to step up and take the reins lyrically which he regarded as having not much experience in prior the biggest inspiration for lyricism was keeping busy and going out instead of locking themselves in and writing urie has regarded the lyrics as very honest and straightforward as well as very fantastical with elements of storytelling urie explained we were so self-conscious about everything hyper-aware of what we’re doing that when we’re writing i go okay i don’t want this to be barry manilow’s mandy but i want it to be as romantic and cute ..’ there’s a lot of that fighting within yourself but it ended up being great and i’m glad that we were able to figure out what we wanted to write about the lyrics also reflect the confusion after the departure of ross and walker 13 the sessions with feldmann at his home studio led to experimentation with new sounds we really loved paul simon and got into using marimbas and string instruments explains urie we ended up buying some synths and messing around with them it was two kids in a candy store… and we listened to arcade fire s the suburbs on repeat for me for the past… well since it came out laughs 17 the ballad of mona lisa has been described by alternative press as having the upbeat pop energy of a fever you can t sweat out with the focus and clarity of pretty odd urie has explained that he and smith desired to achieve a sound that is more similar to the former we missed a couple things from our first record in terms of sonically with these little instruments that we hadn’t really used on our second record there were a lot of organic instruments and not a lot of electronics or synthesizers so we wanted to get back to some of that 13 smith agreed and stated i think there s stuff from the first album that we kind of got away from on the second record that people who were fans of the first one will enjoy 33 the calendar originally written about an intimate relationship between a male and a female soon began to resemble the friendships in former members ross and walker the song was finished as a direct response to their departure from the group sarah smiles was written for urie s wife sarah smiles is about my girlfriend actually as sappy as that is he told spin in 2011 when i met her i wrote this song to try and impress her i was infatuated with her i played it for her and we ve been dating ever since that was a huge step for me personally 17 nearly witches ever since we met.. was rejected for inclusion on pretty odd due it not fitting within the concept of the album urie and smith finished the song for vices virtues 35

lopez tonight a week after that on april 4 2011 40 in promotion of the record smith and urie filmed a short film to accompany the album titled the overture directed by shane drake the film was

critics the album has received an average score of 62 out of 100 which indicates generally favourable reviews based on 15 reviews 52 jarett wieselman of the new york post called the record one of 2011 s best and most captivating albums calling sarah smiles the stand-out and noting the wise change in tone to high-energy with the second track let s kill tonight 63 alternative press also welcomed the new version of panic at the disco perhaps smith and urie s biggest success on vices is their disinterest in simply recreating either of their previous albums instead choosing to meld the youthful exuberance of their debut with the restraint and maturity of 2008 s pretty odd. wrote critic evan lucy the duo sound absolutely recharged likely a result of the lineup shuffling but also perhaps a realization that the 70s were a nice place to visit for a couple years but life in the 21st century is much more fun 54 he went on to praise the elfman-esque string arrangements creepy undertones and twinkling pianos on several tracks and enjoy the scaled-back more personal tracks such as the calendar and memories 54 james montgomery of mtv news said of the album vices is at its very core a studio album one stuffed with ideas and instrumentation which not only positions panic as perhaps this generation s brian-wilsons-on-a-budget but serves as a solid starting point for wherever urie and smith choose to go from here he complimented the new sound of the band it s not exactly new not exactly old but it s definitely something call it a fresh start a return to form a re-imaging of the past just don t call it pretty odd because that ship has sailed panic are back to their old tricks exclamation point and all . and perhaps that was the secret ingredient all along 64 negative criticism for the album mostly came regarding the inexperienced lyrcism of urie william goodman of spin criticized urie s lyrics of the album the result is verbose and generic diary-entry romance but praised the musical experimentation remarking vices virtues s saving grace though is the varied instrumentation – marimbas xylophones accordion synths and digital atmospherics 61 jody rosen of rolling stone concurred with goodman and also focused positive opinion upon the arrangements of the album recommending nearly witches and calling the album emo retropop commenting it s the closest emo has come to the sound of old-school pop and rock with beach boys harmonies and even gypsy-style swing flavoring the usual hopped-up confessions 60 mikael wood of entertainment weekly agreed with these sentiments recommending the ballad of mona-lisa and the harmony-drenched sarah smiles 56 vices virtues tour edit main article vices virtues tour in support of the record panic at the disco announced multiple tours dubbed thus far as an intimate evening with panic at the disco the short north american tour ran from january 23 to april 4 2011 a full-fledged european tour took place may 2–17 2011 65 panic

same electric over-the-top theatricality the band was known for during the fever era i really miss wearing costumes and makeup urie told spin i love throwing a big production i ve recently been

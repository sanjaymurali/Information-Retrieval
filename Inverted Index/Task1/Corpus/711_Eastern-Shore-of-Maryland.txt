maryland and delaware the border was originally marked every mile by a stone and every five miles by a crownstone the line is not quite due north and south but is as straight as survey methods of the

taken as the borderline delaware would be about half its current size finally although this has received less attention than other parts of eastern shore culture commercial east-west ties between delaware towns and maryland towns were culturally significant in colonial and early american periods despite the border line which largely cut through woods and swamps trade with philadelphia was conducted by overland routes to delaware towns like odessa then called cantwell s bridge and smyrna then called duck creek agricultural products and milled grain were taken up the delaware river by

coast of africa on august 20 two days later the system organized enough to be classified a tropical depression just southwest of cape verde for the next few days the system moved west-northwestward with little change in intensity it is estimated the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on august 26 about halfway between the lesser antilles and cape verde initially the storm was elongated although beginning on august 28 it began to intensify more quickly that night the storm attained hurricane status and many nearby ships reported gale force winds 1 on august 29 the hurricane

mayaguana reported a barometric pressure of 930 mbar 27 inhg and hurricane-force winds the pressure would ordinarily suggest winds of 152 mph 245 km h but because it was not reported in the eye and the storm was smaller than normal the winds were estimated at 160 mph 260 km h the hurricane s winds rank as a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale one of two such storms in the 1933

northern cuba near sagua la grande with winds of about 120 mph 190 km h the eye moved along the northern coast of cuba crossing over matanzas shortly thereafter the storm exited into the straits of

28.0 inhg late on september 2 this suggested winds of about 140 mph 230 km h the hurricane turned more to the west on september 3 and as it approached southern texas it weakened slightly as it decelerated at 0400 utc on september 5 the hurricane made its final landfall on south padre island in southern texas with winds estimated at 125 mph 205 km h it quickly weakened over land as it

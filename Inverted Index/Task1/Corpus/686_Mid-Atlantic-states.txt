the composition of the mid-atlantic and has at times included any state from new york to south carolina 7 most commonly included is the mid-atlantic states as defined by the census bureau--new jersey new york and pennsylvania—along with the civil war border states of delaware maryland washington d.c. and west virginia sometimes the nucleus is considered to be the area centered on the washington metropolitan area including maryland virginia delaware and west virginia 8 since the 1910 census the mid-atlantic census division has included new jersey new york and pennsylvania which combined with the new england division comprised the northeast census region 9 a united states geological survey publication describes the mid-atlantic region as all of maryland delaware pennsylvania and virginia along with the parts of new jersey new york and north carolina that drain into the delaware and chesapeake bays and the albemarle and pamlico sounds 10 west virginia and virginia are atypical of this region in several ways they are the only states to lie primarily within the southern american dialect region 11 and the major religious tradition in both states is evangelical christian 31 in virginia and 36 in west virginia 12 although a few of west virginia s eastern panhandle counties are considered part of the washington d.c msa the major portion of the state is rural and there are no major or even large cities 13 the typically american region edit a map of the mid-atlantic as defined by the federal deposit insurance corporation frederick jackson turner wrote in 1893 about the important role the mid-atlantic or middle region had played in the formation of the national american culture and defined it as the typical american region 14 “ the middle region entered by new york harbor was an open door to all europe the tide-water part of the south represented typical englishmen modified by a warm climate and servile labor and living in baronial fashion on great plantations new england stood for a special english movement- puritanism the middle region was less english than the other sections it had a wide mixture of nationalities a varied society the mixed town and county system of local government a varied economic life many religious sects in short it was a region mediating between new england and the south and the east and the west it represented that composite nationality which the contemporary united states exhibits that juxtaposition of non-english groups occupying a valley or a little settlement and presenting reflections of the map of europe in their variety it was democratic and nonsectional if not national easy tolerant and contented rooted strongly in material prosperity it was typical of the modern united states it was least sectional not only because it lay between north and south but also because with no barriers to shut out its frontiers from its settled region and with a system of connecting waterways the middle region mediated between east and west as well as between north and south thus it became the typically american region even the new englander who was shut out from the frontier by the middle region tarrying in new york or pennsylvania on his westward march lost the acuteness of his sectionalism on the way ” — the frontier in american history history edit shipping containers at the port newark-elizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey shipping and trade have been important to the mid-atlantic economy since the beginning of the colonial era the explorer giovanni da verrazzano was the first european to see the region in 1524 henry hudson later extensively explored that region in 1609 and claimed it for the dutch who then created a fur-trading post in albany in 1614 jamestown virginia was the first permanent english colony in north america seven years earlier in 1607 from early colonial times the mid-atlantic region was settled by a wider range of european people than in new england or the south the dutch new netherland settlement along the hudson river in new york and new jersey and for a time new sweden along the delaware river in delaware divided the two great bulwarks of english settlement from each other the original english settlements in the region notably provided refuge to religious minorities maryland to roman catholics and pennsylvania to quakers and the mostly anabaptist pennsylvania dutch in time all these settlements fell under english colonial control but the region continued to be a magnet for people of diverse nationalities the area that came to be known as the middle colonies served as a strategic bridge between the north and south the new york and new jersey campaign during the american revolutionary war saw more battles than any other theater of the conflict philadelphia midway between the northern and southern colonies was home to the continental congress the convention of delegates who organized the american revolution the same city was the birthplace of the declaration of independence in 1776 and the united states constitution in 1787 while the united states bill of rights was drafted and ratified and the first supreme court of the united states sat for the first time in the first capital under the constitution at new york city while early settlers were mostly farmers traders and fishermen the mid-atlantic states provided the young united states with heavy industry and served as the melting pot of new immigrants from europe cities grew along major ports shipping routes and waterways such flourishing cities included new

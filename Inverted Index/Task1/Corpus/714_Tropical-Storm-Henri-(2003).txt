intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on august 22 a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa and it moved westward across the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea without developing significantly on september 1 the wave axis entered the gulf of mexico and upon doing so convection steadily organized around a low-level center of circulation the system moved northward and developed into tropical depression twelve on september 3 while located about 300 miles 480 kilometers west of tampa florida embedded within a slow mid-latitude trough the depression moved eastward and strengthened into tropical storm henri on september 5 1 remnants of henri making landfall on north carolina on september 12 despite strong southwesterly vertical shear henri continued intensifying while moving eastward and reached a peak strength of 60 mph 95 km h later on september 5 shortly thereafter though the shear greatly weakened the storm and it was downgraded to a tropical depression henri was not able to recover its intensity and made landfall near clearwater florida on september 6 as a 35 mph 55 km h tropical depression and quickly crossed the state as it accelerated to the northeast 1 despite initial predictions of re-intensification over open waters due to potentially lower shear 2 henri failed to re-strengthen and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on september 8 off the coast of north carolina 1 the broad and disorganized remnant low remained nearly stationary due to a ridge of high pressure to its north 1 residual convection within the remnants of henri remained disorganized but forecasters kept watch for the potential for redevelopment 3 however it moved inland near cape hatteras on september 12 without reorganizing 4 the remnants continued to the north and dissipated on september 17 over new england 5 preparations edit the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm warning from englewood to indian pass florida while henri was a

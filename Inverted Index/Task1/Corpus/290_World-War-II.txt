although related conflicts began earlier it involved the vast majority of the world s countries—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances the allies and the axis it was the most widespread war in history and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries in a state of total war the major participants threw their entire economic industrial and scientific capabilities behind the war effort erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources world war ii was the deadliest conflict in human history marked by 50 million to 85 million fatalities most of which were civilians in the soviet union and china it included massacres the deliberate genocide of the holocaust strategic bombing starvation disease and the first use of nuclear weapons in history 1 2 3 4 the empire of japan aimed to dominate asia and the pacific and was already at war with the republic of china in 1937 5 but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 september 1939 6 with the invasion of poland by nazi germany and subsequent declarations of war on germany by france and the united kingdom supplied by the soviet union from late 1939 to early 1941 in a series of campaigns and treaties germany conquered or controlled much of continental europe and formed the axis alliance with italy and japan under the molotov–ribbentrop pact of august 1939 germany and the soviet union partitioned and annexed territories of their european neighbours poland finland romania and the baltic states the war continued primarily between the european axis powers and the coalition of the united kingdom and the british commonwealth with campaigns including the north africa and east africa campaigns the aerial battle of britain the blitz bombing campaign the balkan campaign as well as the long-running battle of the atlantic on 22 june 1941 the european axis powers launched an invasion of the soviet union opening the largest land theatre of war in history which trapped the major part of the axis military forces into a war of attrition in december 1941 japan attacked the united states and european colonies in the pacific ocean and quickly conquered much of the western pacific the axis advance halted in 1942 when japan lost the critical battle of midway and germany and italy were defeated in north africa and then decisively at stalingrad in the soviet union in 1943 with a series of german defeats on the eastern front the allied invasion of sicily and the allied invasion of italy which brought about italian surrender and allied victories in the pacific the axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts in 1944 the western allies invaded german-occupied france while the soviet union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded germany and its allies during 1944 and 1945 the japanese suffered major reverses in mainland asia in south central china and burma while the allies crippled the japanese navy and captured key western pacific islands the war in europe concluded with an invasion of germany by the western allies and the soviet union culminating in the capture of berlin by soviet troops the suicide of adolf hitler and the subsequent german unconditional surrender on 8 may 1945 following the potsdam declaration by the allies on 26 july 1945 and the refusal of japan to surrender under its terms the united states dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki on 6 august and 9 august respectively with an invasion of the japanese archipelago imminent the possibility of additional atomic bombings and the soviet invasion of manchuria japan formally surrendered on 2 september 1945 thus ended the war in asia cementing the total victory of the allies world war ii altered the political alignment and social structure of the world the united nations un was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts the victorious great powers—china france the soviet union the united kingdom and the united states—became the permanent members of the united nations security council 7 the soviet union and the united states emerged as rival superpowers setting the stage for the cold war which lasted for the next 46 years meanwhile the influence of european great powers waned while the decolonisation of africa and asia began most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery political integration especially in europe emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity 8

poland britain and france declared war on germany two days later the dates for the beginning of war in the pacific include the start of the second sino-japanese war on 7 july 1937 11 12 or even the japanese invasion of manchuria on 19 september 1931 13 14 others follow the british historian a j p taylor who held that the sino-japanese war and war in europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and the two wars merged in 1941 this article uses the conventional dating other starting dates sometimes used for world war ii include the italian invasion of abyssinia on 3 october 1935 15 the british historian antony beevor views the beginning of world war ii as the battles of khalkhin gol fought between japan and the forces of mongolia and the soviet union from may to september 1939 16 the exact date of the war s end is also not universally agreed upon it was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14 august 1945 v-j day rather than the formal surrender of japan 2 september 1945 a peace treaty with japan was signed in 1951 17 a treaty regarding germany s future allowed the reunification of east and west germany to take place in 1990 and resolved other post-world war ii issues 18 background main article causes of world war ii europe world war i had radically altered the political european map with the defeat of the central powers—including austria-hungary germany bulgaria and the ottoman empire—and the 1917 bolshevik seizure of power in russia which eventually led to the founding of the soviet union meanwhile the victorious allies of world war i such as france belgium italy romania and greece gained territory and new nation-states were created out of the collapse of austria-hungary and the ottoman and russian empires the league of nations assembly held in geneva switzerland 1930 to prevent a future world war the league of nations was created during the 1919 paris peace conference the organisation s primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security military and naval disarmament and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration despite strong pacifist sentiment after world war i 19 its aftermath still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several european states these sentiments were especially marked in germany because of the significant territorial colonial and financial losses incurred by the treaty of versailles under the treaty germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory and all of its overseas possessions while german annexation of other states was prohibited reparations were imposed and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country s armed forces 20 the german empire was dissolved in the german revolution of 1918–1919 and a democratic government later known as the weimar republic was created the interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the right and left italy as an entente ally had made some post-war territorial gains however italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by britain and france to secure italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement from 1922 to 1925 the fascist movement led by benito mussolini seized power in italy with a nationalist totalitarian and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy repressed socialist left-wing and liberal forces and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making italy a world power promising the creation of a new roman empire 21 adolf hitler at a german national socialist political rally in weimar october 1930 adolf hitler after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the german government in 1923 eventually became the chancellor of germany in 1933 he abolished democracy espousing a radical racially motivated revision of the world order and soon began a massive rearmament campaign 22 meanwhile france to secure its alliance allowed italy a free hand in ethiopia which italy desired as a colonial possession the situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the territory of the saar basin was legally reunited with germany and hitler repudiated the treaty of versailles accelerated his rearmament programme and introduced conscription 23 to contain germany the united kingdom france and italy formed the stresa front in april 1935 however that june the united kingdom made an independent naval agreement with germany easing prior restrictions the soviet union concerned by germany s goals of capturing vast areas of eastern europe drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with france before taking effect though the franco-soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the league of nations which rendered it essentially toothless 24 the united states concerned with events in europe and asia passed the neutrality act in august of the same year 25 hitler defied the versailles and locarno treaties by remilitarising the rhineland in march 1936 encountering little opposition 26 in october 1936 germany and italy formed the rome–berlin axis a month later germany and japan signed the anti-comintern pact which italy would join in the following year asia the kuomintang kmt party in china launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified china in the mid-1920s but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former chinese communist party allies 27 and new regional warlords in 1931 an increasingly militaristic empire of japan which had long sought influence in china 28 as the first step of what its government saw as the country s right to rule asia used the mukden incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of manchuria and establish the puppet state of manchukuo 29 too weak to resist japan china appealed to the league of nations for help japan withdrew from the league of nations after being condemned for its incursion into manchuria the two nations then fought several battles in shanghai rehe and hebei until the tanggu truce was signed in 1933 thereafter chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to japanese aggression in manchuria and chahar and suiyuan 30 after the 1936 xi an incident the kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose japan 31 pre-war events italian invasion of ethiopia 1935 main article second italo-ethiopian war italian soldiers recruited in 1935 on their way to fight the second italo-abyssinian war the second italo–abyssinian war was a brief colonial war that began in october 1935 and ended in may 1936 the war began with the invasion of the ethiopian empire also known as abyssinia by the armed forces of the kingdom of italy regno d italia which was launched from italian somaliland and eritrea 32 the war resulted in the military occupation of ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of italian east africa africa orientale italiana or aoi in addition it exposed the weakness of the league of nations as a force to preserve peace both italy and ethiopia were member nations but the league did nothing when the former clearly violated the league s article x 33 germany was the only major european nation to support the invasion italy subsequently dropped its objections to germany s goal of absorbing austria 34 spanish civil war 1936–39 main article spanish civil war the bombing of guernica in 1937 during the spanish civil war sparked europe-wide fears that the next war would be based on bombing of cities with very high civilian casualties when civil war broke out in spain hitler and mussolini lent military support to the nationalist rebels led by general francisco franco the soviet union supported the existing government the spanish republic over 30,000 foreign volunteers known as the international brigades also fought against the nationalists both germany and the ussr used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics the nationalists won the civil war in april 1939 franco now dictator remained officially neutral during second world war but generally favoured the axis 35 his greatest collaboration with germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the eastern front 36 japanese invasion of china 1937 main article second sino-japanese war japanese imperial army soldiers during the battle of shanghai 1937 in july 1937 japan captured the former chinese imperial capital of peking after instigating the marco polo bridge incident which culminated in the japanese campaign to invade all of china 37 the soviets quickly signed a non-aggression pact with china to lend materiel support effectively ending china s prior co-operation with germany from september to november the japanese attacked taiyuan 38 39 as well as engaging the kuomintang army around xinkou 38 39 and communist forces in pingxingguan 40 41 generalissimo chiang kai-shek deployed his best army to defend shanghai but after three months of fighting shanghai fell the japanese continued to push the chinese forces back capturing the capital nanking in december 1937 after the fall of nanking tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the japanese 42 43 in march 1938 nationalist chinese forces won their first major victory at taierzhuang but then the city of xuzhou was taken by japanese in may 44 in june 1938 chinese forces stalled the japanese advance by flooding the yellow river this manoeuvre bought time for the chinese to prepare their defences at wuhan but the city was taken by october 45 japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of chinese resistance that japan had hoped to achieve instead the chinese government relocated inland to chongqing and continued the war 46 47 soviet–japanese border conflicts red army artillery unit during the battle of lake khasan 1938 main article soviet–japanese border conflicts in the mid-to-late 1930s japanese forces in manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the soviet union and the mongolian people s republic the japanese doctrine of hokushin-ron which emphasised japan s expansion northward was favoured by the imperial army during this time with the japanese defeat at khalkin gol in 1939 the ongoing second sino-japanese war 48 and ally nazi germany pursuing neutrality with the soviets this policy would prove difficult to maintain japan and the soviet union eventually signed a neutrality pact in april 1941 and japan adopted the doctrine of nanshin-ron promoted by the navy which took its focus southward eventually leading to its war with the united states and the western allies 49 50 european occupations and agreements further information anschluss appeasement munich agreement german occupation of czechoslovakia and molotov–ribbentrop pact chamberlain daladier hitler mussolini and ciano pictured just before signing the munich agreement 29 september 1938 in europe germany and italy were becoming more aggressive in march 1938 germany annexed austria again provoking little response from other european powers 51 encouraged hitler began pressing german claims on the sudetenland an area of czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic german population and soon britain and france followed the counsel of british prime minister neville chamberlain and conceded this territory to germany in the munich agreement which was made against the wishes of the czechoslovak government in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands 52 soon afterwards germany and italy forced czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to hungary and poland annexed czechoslovakia s zaolzie region 53 although all of germany s stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement privately hitler was furious that british interference had prevented him from seizing all of czechoslovakia in one operation in subsequent speeches hitler attacked british and jewish war-mongers and in january 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the german navy to challenge british naval supremacy in march 1939 germany invaded the remainder of czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the german protectorate of bohemia and moravia and a pro-german client state the slovak republic 54 hitler also delivered an ultimatum to lithuania forcing the concession of the klaipėda region greatly alarmed and with hitler making further demands on the free city of danzig britain and france guaranteed their support for polish independence when italy conquered albania in april 1939 the same guarantee was extended to romania and greece 55 shortly after the franco-british pledge to poland germany and italy formalised their own alliance with the pact of steel 56 hitler accused britain and poland of trying to encircle germany and renounced the anglo-german naval agreement and the german–polish non-aggression pact german foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop right and the soviet leader joseph stalin after signing the molotov–ribbentrop pact 23 august 1939 in august 1939 germany and the soviet union signed the molotov–ribbentrop pact 57 a non-aggression treaty with a secret protocol the parties gave each other rights to spheres of influence western poland and lithuania for germany eastern poland finland estonia latvia and bessarabia for the ussr it also raised the question of continuing polish independence 58 the agreement was crucial to hitler because it assured that germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war as it had in world war i after it defeated poland the situation reached a general crisis in late august as german troops continued to mobilise against the polish border in a private meeting with the italian foreign minister count ciano hitler asserted that poland was a doubtful neutral that needed to either yield to his demands or be liquidated to prevent it from drawing off german troops in the future unavoidable war with the western democracies he did not believe britain or france would intervene in the conflict 59 on 23 august hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 august but upon hearing that britain had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with poland and that italy would maintain neutrality he decided to delay it 60 in response to british requests for direct negotiations to avoid war germany made demands on poland which only served as a pretext to worsen relations 61 on 29 august hitler demanded that a polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to berlin to negotiate the handover of danzig and to allow a plebiscite in the polish corridor in which the german minority would vote on secession 61 the poles refused to comply with the german demands and on the night of 30–31 august in a violent meeting with the british ambassador neville henderson ribbentrop declared that germany considered its claims rejected 62 course of the war further information diplomatic history of world war ii war breaks out in europe 1939–40 main articles invasion of poland phoney war

fully independent dominions 64 of the british commonwealth 65 —australia 3 september canada 10 september new zealand 3 september and south africa 6 september —declared war on germany however initially the alliance provided limited direct military support to poland consisting of a cautious half-hearted french probe into the saarland 66 the western allies also began a naval blockade of germany which aimed to damage the country s economy and war effort 67 germany responded by ordering u-boat warfare against allied merchant and warships which was to later escalate into the battle of the atlantic german tanks near the city of bydgoszcz during the invasion of poland september 1939 on 17 september 1939 after signing a cease-fire with japan the soviets invaded poland from the east 68 the polish army was defeated and warsaw surrendered to the germans on 27 september with final pockets of resistance surrendering on 6 october poland s territory was divided between germany and the soviet union with lithuania and slovakia also receiving small shares after the defeat of poland s armed forces the polish resistance established an underground state and a partisan home army 69 about 100,000 polish military personnel were evacuated to romania and the baltic countries many of these soldiers later fought against the germans in other theatres of the war 70 poland s enigma codebreakers were also evacuated to france 71 on 6 october hitler made a public peace overture to britain and france but said that the future of poland was to be determined exclusively by germany and the soviet union chamberlain rejected this on 12 october saying past experience has shown that no reliance can be placed upon the promises of the present german government 62 after this rejection hitler ordered an immediate offensive against france 72 but bad weather forced repeated postponements until the spring of 1940 73 74 75 german and soviet army officers pictured shaking hands—after nazi germany and

allies were attempting to cut off by unilaterally mining neutral norwegian waters 86 denmark capitulated after a few hours and despite allied support during which the important harbour of narvik temporarily was recaptured from the germans norway was conquered within two months 87 british discontent over the norwegian campaign led to the replacement of the british prime minister neville chamberlain with winston churchill on 10 may 1940 88 germany launched an offensive against france and adhering to the manstein plan also attacked the neutral nations of belgium the netherlands and luxembourg on 10 may 1940 89 that same day british forces landed in iceland and the faroes to preempt a possible german invasion of the islands 90 the u.s. in close co-operation with the danish envoy to washington d.c. agreed to protect greenland laying the political framework for the formal establishment of bases in april 1941 the netherlands and belgium were overrun using blitzkrieg tactics in a few days and weeks respectively 91 the french-fortified maginot line and the main body of the allied forces which had moved into belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly wooded ardennes region 92 mistakenly perceived by allied planners as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles 93 94 as a result the bulk of the allied armies found themselves trapped in an encirclement and were beaten the majority were taken prisoner whilst over 300,000 mostly british and french were evacuated from the continent at dunkirk by early june although abandoning almost all of their equipment 95 on 10 june italy invaded france declaring war on both france and the united kingdom 96 paris fell to the germans on 14 june and eight days later france signed an armistice with germany and was soon divided into german and italian occupation zones 97 and an unoccupied rump state under the vichy regime which though officially neutral was generally aligned with germany

luftwaffe s assault and the german bombing campaign largely ended in may 1941 104 throughout this period the neutral united states took measures to assist china and the western allies in november 1939 the american neutrality act was amended to allow cash and carry purchases by the allies 105 in 1940 following the german capture of paris the size of the united states navy was significantly increased in september the united states further agreed to a trade of american destroyers for british bases 106 still a large majority of the american public continued to oppose any direct military intervention into the conflict well into 1941 107 although roosevelt had promised to keep the united states out of the war he nevertheless took concrete steps to prepare for war in december 1940 he accused hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out negotiations as useless calling for the us to become an arsenal of democracy and promoted the passage of lend-lease aid to support the british war effort 101 in january 1941 secret high level staff talks with the british began for the purposes of determining how to defeat germany should the us enter the war they decided on a number of offensive policies including an air offensive the early elimination of italy raids support of resistance groups and the capture of positions to launch an offensive against germany 108 at the end of september 1940 the tripartite pact united japan italy and germany to formalise the axis powers the tripartite pact stipulated that any country with the exception of the soviet union not in the war which attacked any axis power would be forced to go to war against all three 109 the axis expanded in november 1940 when hungary slovakia and romania joined the tripartite pact 110 romania would make a major

egypt in september 1940 in october 1940 italy started the greco-italian war because of mussolini s jealousy of hitler s success but within days was repulsed with few territorial gains and a stalemate soon occurred 112 the united kingdom responded to greek requests for assistance by sending troops to crete and providing air support to greece hitler decided that when the weather improved he would take action against greece to assist the italians and prevent the british from gaining a foothold in the balkans to strike against the british naval dominance of the mediterranean and to secure his hold on romanian oil 113 in december 1940 british commonwealth forces began counter-offensives against italian forces in egypt and italian east africa 114 the offensive in north africa was highly successful and by early february 1941 italy had lost control of eastern libya and large numbers of italian troops had been taken prisoner the italian navy also suffered significant defeats with the royal navy putting three italian battleships out of commission by a carrier attack at taranto and neutralising several more warships at the battle of cape matapan 115 captured german afrika korps soldiers december 1941 the germans soon intervened to assist italy hitler sent german forces to libya in february and by the end of march the axis had launched an offensive which drove back the commonwealth forces which had been weakened to support greece 116 in under a month commonwealth forces were pushed back into egypt with the exception of the besieged port of tobruk that fell later 117 the commonwealth attempted to dislodge axis forces in may and again in june but failed on both occasions 118 by late march 1941 following bulgaria s signing of the tripartite pact the germans were in position to intervene in greece plans were changed however because of developments in neighbouring yugoslavia the yugoslav government had signed the tripartite pact on 25 march only to be overthrown two days later by a british-encouraged coup hitler viewed the new regime as hostile and immediately decided to eliminate it on 6 april germany simultaneously invaded both yugoslavia and greece making rapid progress and forcing both nations to surrender within the month the british were driven from the balkans after germany conquered the greek island of crete by the end of may 119 although the axis victory was swift bitter partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the axis occupation of yugoslavia which continued until the end of the war the allies did have some successes during this time in the middle east commonwealth forces first quashed an uprising in iraq which had been supported by german aircraft from bases within vichy-controlled syria 120 then with the assistance of the free

122 by contrast the germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the soviet union massing forces on the soviet border 123 hitler believed that britain s refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the united states and the soviet union would enter the war against germany sooner or later 124 he therefore decided to try to strengthen germany s relations with the soviets or failing that to attack and eliminate them as a factor in november 1940 negotiations took place to determine if the soviet union would join the tripartite pact the soviets showed some interest but

during the summer the axis made significant gains into soviet territory inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel by the middle of august however the german army high command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted army group centre and to divert the 2nd panzer group to reinforce troops advancing towards central ukraine and leningrad 131 page needed the kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful resulting in encirclement and elimination of four soviet armies and made possible further advance into crimea and industrially developed eastern ukraine the first battle of kharkov 132 soviet civilians in leningrad leaving destroyed houses after a german bombardment of the city battle of leningrad 10 december 1942 the diversion of three quarters of the

started on 5 december all along the front and pushed german troops 100–250 kilometres 62–155 mi west 146 war breaks out in the pacific 1941 main article pacific war in 1939 the united states had renounced its trade treaty with japan and beginning with an aviation gasoline ban in july 1940 japan became subject to increasing economic pressure 101 during this time japan launched its first attack against changsha a strategically important chinese city but was repulsed by late september 147 despite several offensives by both sides the war between china and japan was stalemated by 1940 to increase pressure on china by blocking supply routes and to better position japanese forces in the event of a war with the western powers japan invaded and occupied northern indochina 148 afterwards the united states embargoed iron steel and mechanical parts against japan 149 other sanctions soon followed chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940 in august chinese communists launched an offensive in central china in retaliation japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists 150 continued antipathy between chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in january 1941 effectively ending their co-operation 151 in march the japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the chinese 19th army but was repulsed during battle of shanggao 152 in september japan attempted to take the city of changsha again and clashed with chinese nationalist forces 153 mitsubishi a6m2 zero fighters on the imperial japanese navy aircraft carrier shōkaku just before the attack on pearl harbor german successes in europe encouraged japan to increase pressure on european governments in southeast asia the dutch government agreed to provide japan some oil supplies from the dutch east indies but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in june 1941 154 in july 1941 japan sent troops to southern indochina thus threatening british and dutch possessions in the far east the united states united kingdom and other western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on japanese assets and a total oil embargo 155 156 at the same time japan was planning an invasion of the soviet far east intending to capitalize off the german invasion in the west but abandoned the operation after the sanctions 157 since early 1941 the united states and japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in china during these negotiations japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the americans as inadequate 158 at the same time the us britain and the netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories in the event of a japanese attack against any of them 159 roosevelt reinforced the philippines an american protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946 and warned japan that the us would react to japanese attacks against any neighboring countries 159 uss arizona during the japanese surprise air attack on the american pacific fleet 7 december 1941 frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the american-british-dutch sanctions japan prepared for war on 20 november a new government under hideki tojo presented an interim proposal as its final offer it called for the end of american aid to china and for the supply of oil and other resources to japan in exchange japan promised not to launch any attacks in southeast asia and to withdraw its forces from southern indochina 158 the american counter-proposal of 26 november required that japan evacuate all of china without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all pacific powers 160 that meant japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in china or seizing the natural resources it needed in the dutch east indies by force 161 the japanese military did not consider the former an option and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war 162 japan planned to rapidly seize european colonies in asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the central pacific the japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of southeast asia while exhausting the over-stretched allies by fighting a defensive war 163 to prevent american intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the united states pacific fleet and the american military presence in the philippines from the outset 164 on 7 december 1941 8 december in asian time zones japan attacked british and american holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against southeast asia and the central pacific 165 these included an attack on the american fleet at pearl harbor the philippines landings in thailand and malaya 165 and the battle of hong kong these attacks led the united states britain china australia and several other states to formally declare war on japan whereas the soviet union being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with european axis countries maintained its neutrality agreement with japan 166 germany followed by the other axis states declared war on the united states 167 in solidarity with japan citing as justification the american attacks on german war vessels that had been ordered by roosevelt 125 168 axis advance stalls 1942–43 seated at the casablanca conference us president franklin d roosevelt and british pm winston churchill january 1943 on 1 january 1942 the allied big four 169 —the soviet union china britain and the united states—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the declaration by united nations thereby affirming the atlantic charter 170 and agreeing to not to sign a separate peace with the axis powers during 1942 allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue all agreed that defeating germany was the primary objective the americans favoured a straightforward large-scale attack on germany through france the soviets were also demanding a second front the british on the other hand argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out german strength leading to increasing demoralisation and bolster resistance forces germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign an offensive against germany would then be launched primarily by allied armour without using large-scale armies 171 eventually the british persuaded the americans that a landing in france was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the axis out of north africa 172 at the casablanca conference in early 1943 the allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 declaration by the united nations and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies the british and americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the mediterranean by invading sicily to fully secure the mediterranean supply routes 173 although the british argued for further operations in the balkans to bring turkey into the war in may 1943 the americans extracted a british commitment to limit allied operations in the mediterranean to an invasion of the italian mainland and to invade france in 1944 174 pacific 1942–43 map of japanese military advances until mid-1942 by the end of april 1942 japan and its ally thailand had almost fully conquered burma malaya the dutch east indies singapore and rabaul inflicting severe losses on allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners 175 despite stubborn resistance by filipino and us forces the philippine commonwealth was eventually captured in may 1942 forcing its government into exile 176 on 16 april in burma 7,000 british soldiers were encircled by the japanese 33rd division during the battle of yenangyaung and rescued by the chinese 38th division 177 japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the south china sea java sea and indian ocean 178 and bombed the allied naval base at darwin australia in january 1942 the only allied success against japan was a chinese victory at changsha 179 these easy victories over unprepared us and european opponents left japan overconfident as well as overextended 180 in early may 1942 japan initiated operations to capture port moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the united states and australia the planned invasion was thwarted when an allied task force centred on two american fleet carriers fought japanese naval forces to a draw in the battle of the coral sea 181 japan s next plan motivated by the earlier doolittle raid was to seize midway atoll and lure american carriers into battle to be eliminated as a diversion japan would also send forces to occupy the aleutian islands in alaska 182 in mid-may japan started the zhejiang-jiangxi campaign in china with the goal of inflicting retribution on the chinese who aided the surviving american airmen in the doolittle raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the chinese 23rd and 32nd army groups 183 184 in early june japan put its operations into action but the americans having broken japanese naval codes in late may were fully aware of plans and order of battle and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at midway over the imperial japanese navy 185 us marines during the guadalcanal campaign in the pacific theatre 1942 with its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the midway battle japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture port moresby by an overland campaign in the territory of papua 186 the americans planned a counter-attack against japanese positions in the southern solomon islands primarily guadalcanal as a first step towards capturing rabaul the main japanese base in southeast asia 187 both plans started in july but by mid-september the battle for guadalcanal took priority for the japanese and troops in new guinea were ordered to withdraw from the port moresby area to the northern part of the island where they faced australian and united states troops in the battle of buna-gona 188 guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for guadalcanal by the start of 1943 the japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops 189 in burma commonwealth forces mounted two operations the first an offensive into the arakan region in late 1942 went disastrously forcing a retreat back to india by may 1943 190 the second was the insertion of irregular forces behind japanese front-lines in february which by the end of april had achieved mixed results 191 eastern front 1942–43 red army soldiers on the counterattack during the battle of stalingrad february 1943 despite considerable losses in early 1942 germany and its allies stopped a major soviet offensive in central and southern russia keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year 192 in may the germans defeated soviet offensives in the kerch peninsula and at kharkov 193 and then launched their main summer offensive against southern russia in june 1942 to seize the oil fields of the caucasus and occupy kuban steppe while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front the germans split army group south into two groups army group a advanced to the lower don river and struck south-east to the caucasus while army group b headed towards the volga river the soviets decided to make their stand at stalingrad on the volga 194 by mid-november the germans had nearly taken stalingrad in bitter street fighting when the soviets began their second winter counter-offensive starting with an encirclement of german forces at stalingrad 195 and an assault on the rzhev salient near moscow though the latter failed disastrously 196 by early february 1943 the german army had taken tremendous losses german troops at stalingrad had been forced to surrender 197 and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive in mid-february after the soviet push had tapered off the germans launched another attack on kharkov creating a salient in their front line around the russian city of kursk 198 western europe atlantic mediterranean 1942–43 american 8th air force boeing b-17 flying fortress bombing raid on the focke-wulf factory in germany 9 october 1943 exploiting poor american naval command decisions the german navy ravaged allied shipping off the american atlantic coast 199 by november 1941 commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive operation crusader in north africa and reclaimed all the gains the germans and italians had made 200 in north africa the germans launched an offensive in january pushing the british back to positions at the gazala line by early february 201 followed by a temporary lull in combat which germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives 202 concerns the japanese might use bases in vichy-held madagascar caused the british to invade the island in early may 1942 203 an axis offensive in libya forced an allied retreat deep inside egypt until axis forces were stopped at el alamein 204 on the continent raids of allied commandos on strategic targets culminating in the disastrous dieppe raid 205 demonstrated the western allies inability to launch an invasion of continental europe without much better preparation equipment and operational security 206 page needed in august 1942 the allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against el alamein 207 and at a high cost managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged malta 208 a few months later the allies commenced an attack of their own in egypt dislodging the axis forces and beginning a drive west across libya 209 this attack was followed up shortly after by anglo-american landings in french north africa which resulted in the region joining the allies 210 hitler responded to the french colony s defection by ordering the occupation of vichy france 210 although vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by german forces 210 211 the now pincered axis forces in africa withdrew into tunisia which was conquered by the allies in may 1943 210 212 in early 1943 the british and americans began the combined bomber offensive a strategic bombing campaign against germany the goals were to disrupt the german war economy reduce german morale and de-house the civilian population 213 allies gain momentum 1943–44 us navy sbd-5 scout plane flies patrol over uss washington and uss lexington during the gilbert and marshall islands campaign 1943 after the guadalcanal campaign the allies initiated several operations against japan in the pacific in may 1943 canadian and u.s forces were sent to eliminate japanese forces from the aleutians 214 soon after the u.s. with support from australian and new zealand forces began major operations to isolate rabaul by capturing surrounding islands and breach the japanese central pacific perimeter at the gilbert and marshall islands 215 by the end of march 1944 the allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major japanese base at truk in the caroline islands in april the allies launched an operation to retake western new guinea 216 in the soviet union both the germans and the soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central russia on 4 july 1943 germany attacked soviet forces around the kursk bulge within a week german forces had exhausted themselves against the soviets deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences 217 and for the first time in the war hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success 218 this decision was partially affected by the western allies invasion of sicily launched on 9 july which combined with previous italian failures resulted in the ousting and arrest of mussolini later that month 219 also in july 1943 the british firebombed hamburg killing over 40,000 people 220 red army troops in a counter-offensive on german positions at the battle of kursk 1943 on 12 july 1943 the soviets launched their own counter-offensives thereby dispelling any chance of german victory or even stalemate in the east the soviet victory at kursk marked the end of german superiority 221 giving the soviet union the initiative on the eastern front 222 223 the germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified panther–wotan line but the soviets broke through it at smolensk and by the lower dnieper offensives 224 on 3 september 1943 the western allies invaded the italian mainland following italy s armistice with the allies 225 germany with the help of fascists responded by disarming italian forces that were in many places without superior orders seizing military control of italian areas 226 and creating a series of defensive lines 227 german special forces then rescued mussolini who then soon established a new client state in german-occupied italy named the italian social republic 228 causing an italian civil war the western allies fought through several lines until reaching the main german defensive line in mid-november 229 the allied leaders of the asian and pacific theatre generalissimo chiang kai-shek franklin d roosevelt and winston churchill meeting at the cairo conference 25 november 1943 german operations in the atlantic also suffered by may 1943 as allied counter-measures became increasingly effective the resulting sizeable german submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the german atlantic naval campaign 230 in november 1943 franklin d roosevelt and winston churchill met with chiang kai-shek in cairo and then with joseph stalin in tehran 231 the former conference determined the post-war return of japanese territory 232 and the military planning for the burma campaign 233 while the latter included agreement that the western allies would invade europe in 1944 and that the soviet union would declare war on japan within three months of germany s defeat 234 ruins of the benedictine monastery during the battle of monte cassino italian campaign may 1944 from november 1943 during the seven-week battle of changde the chinese forced japan to fight a costly war of attrition while awaiting allied relief 235 236 237 in january 1944 the allies launched a series of attacks in italy against the line at monte cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at anzio 238 by the end of january a major soviet offensive expelled german forces from the leningrad region 239 ending the longest and most lethal siege in history the following soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war estonian border by the german army group north aided by estonians hoping to re-establish national independence this delay slowed subsequent soviet operations in the baltic sea region 240 by late may 1944 the soviets had liberated crimea largely expelled axis forces from ukraine and made incursions into romania which were repulsed by the axis troops 241 the allied offensives in italy had succeeded and at the expense of allowing several german divisions to retreat on 4 june rome was captured 242 the allies had mixed success in mainland asia in march 1944 the japanese launched the first of two invasions an operation against british positions in assam india 243 and soon besieged commonwealth positions at imphal and kohima 244 in may 1944 british forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove japanese troops back to burma 244 and chinese forces that had invaded northern burma in late 1943 besieged japanese troops in myitkyina 245 the second japanese invasion of china aimed to destroy china s main fighting forces secure railways between japanese-held territory and capture allied airfields 246 by june the japanese had conquered the province of henan and begun a new attack on changsha in the hunan province 247 allies close in 1944 american troops approaching omaha beach during the invasion of normandy on d-day 6 june 1944 on 6 june 1944 known as d-day after three years of soviet pressure 248 the western allies invaded northern france after reassigning several allied divisions from italy they also attacked southern france 249 these landings were successful and led to the defeat of the german army units in france paris was liberated by the local resistance assisted by the free french forces both led by general charles de gaulle on 25 august 250 and the western allies continued to push back german forces in western europe during the latter part of the year an attempt to advance into northern germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the netherlands failed 251 after that the western allies slowly pushed into germany but failed to cross the ruhr river in a large offensive in italy allied advance also slowed due to the last major german defensive line 252 german ss soldiers from the dirlewanger brigade tasked with suppressing the warsaw uprising against nazi occupation august 1944 on 22 june the soviets launched a strategic offensive in belarus operation bagration that destroyed the german army group centre almost completely 253 soon after that another soviet strategic offensive forced german troops from western ukraine and eastern poland the soviet advance prompted resistance forces in poland to initiate several uprisings against the german occupation however the largest of these in warsaw where german soldiers massacred 200,000 civilians and a national uprising in slovakia did not receive soviet support and were subsequently suppressed by the germans 254 the red army s strategic offensive in eastern romania cut off and destroyed the considerable german troops there and triggered a successful coup d état in romania and in bulgaria followed by those countries shift to the allied side 255 in september 1944 soviet troops advanced into yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of german army groups e and f in greece albania and yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off 256 by this point the communist-led partisans under marshal josip broz tito who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941 controlled much of the territory of yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against german forces further south in northern serbia the red army with limited support from bulgarian forces assisted the partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of belgrade on 20 october a few days later the soviets launched a massive assault against german-occupied hungary that lasted until the fall of budapest in february 1945 257 unlike impressive soviet victories in the balkans bitter finnish resistance to the soviet offensive in the karelian isthmus denied the soviets occupation of finland and led to a soviet-finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions 258 259 although finland was forced to fight their former allies general douglas macarthur lands at leyte during the battle of leyte 20 october 1944 by the start of july 1944 commonwealth forces in southeast asia had repelled the japanese sieges in assam pushing the japanese back to the chindwin river 260 while the chinese captured myitkyina in september 1944 chinese force captured the mount song to reopen the burma road 261 in china the japanese had more successes having finally captured changsha in mid-june and the city of hengyang by early august 262 soon after they invaded the province of guangxi winning major engagements against chinese forces at guilin and liuzhou by the end of november 263 and successfully linking up their forces in china and indochina by mid-december 264 in the pacific us forces continued to press back the japanese perimeter in mid-june 1944 they began their offensive against the mariana and palau islands and decisively defeated japanese forces in the battle of the philippine sea these defeats led to the resignation of the japanese prime minister hideki tojo and provided the united states with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the japanese home islands in late october american forces invaded the filipino island of leyte soon after allied naval forces scored another large victory in the battle of leyte gulf one of the largest naval battles in history 265 axis collapse allied victory 1944–45 yalta conference held in february 1945 with winston churchill franklin d roosevelt and joseph stalin on 16 december 1944 germany made a last attempt on the western front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the ardennes and along the french–german border to split the western allies encircle large portions of western allied troops and capture their primary supply port at antwerp to prompt a political settlement 266 by january the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled 266 in italy the western allies remained stalemated at the german defensive line in mid-january 1945 the soviets and poles attacked in poland pushing from the vistula to the oder river in germany and overran east prussia 267 on 4 february soviet british and us leaders met for the yalta conference they agreed on the occupation of post-war germany and on when the soviet union would join the war against japan 268 in february the soviets entered silesia and pomerania while western allies entered western germany and closed to the rhine river by march the western allies crossed the rhine north and south of the ruhr encircling the german army group b 269 while the soviets advanced to vienna in early april the western allies finally pushed forward in italy and swept across western germany capturing hamburg and nuremberg while soviet and polish forces stormed berlin in late april american and soviet forces met at the elbe river on 25 april on 30 april 1945 the reichstag was captured signalling the military defeat of nazi germany 270 several changes in leadership occurred during this period on 12 april president roosevelt died and was succeeded by harry s truman benito mussolini was killed by italian partisans on 28 april 271 two days later hitler committed suicide and was succeeded by grand admiral karl dönitz 272 the german

forces started to counterattack in battle of west hunan that occurred between 6 april and 7 june 1945 american naval and amphibious forces also moved towards japan taking iwo jima by march and okinawa by the end of june 278 at the same time american submarines cut off japanese imports drastically reducing japan s ability to supply its overseas forces 279 japanese foreign affairs minister mamoru shigemitsu signs the japanese instrument of surrender on board uss missouri 2 september 1945 on 11 july allied leaders met in potsdam germany they confirmed earlier agreements about germany 280 and reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of all japanese forces by japan specifically stating that the alternative for japan is prompt and utter destruction 281 during this conference the united kingdom held its general election and clement attlee replaced churchill as prime minister 282 the allies called for unconditional japanese surrender in the potsdam declaration of 27 july but the japanese government rejected the call in early august the usaaf dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki the allies justified the atomic bombings as a military necessity to avoid invading the japanese home islands which would cost the lives of between 250,000 and 500,000 allied servicemen and millions of japanese troops and civilians 283 between the two bombings the soviets pursuant to the yalta agreement invaded japanese-held manchuria and quickly defeated the kwantung army which was the largest japanese fighting force 284 285 the red army also captured sakhalin island and the kuril islands on 15 august 1945 japan surrendered with the surrender documents finally signed at tokyo bay on the deck of the american battleship uss missouri on 2 september 1945 ending the war 286 aftermath main articles aftermath of world war ii and consequences of nazism defendants at the nuremberg trials where the allied forces prosecuted prominent members of the political military judicial and economic leadership of nazi germany for crimes against humanity the allies established occupation administrations in austria and germany the former became a neutral state non-aligned with any political bloc the latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the western allies and the ussr accordingly a denazification programme in germany led to the prosecution of nazi war criminals and the removal of ex-nazis from power although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-nazis into west german society 287 ruins of warsaw in january 1945 after the deliberate destruction of the city by the occupying german forces germany lost a quarter of its pre-war 1937 territory among the eastern territories silesia neumark and most of pomerania were taken over by poland east prussia was divided between poland and the ussr followed by the expulsion of the 9 million germans from these provinces as well as the expulsion of 3 million germans from the sudetenland in czechoslovakia to germany by the 1950s every fifth west german was a refugee from the east the soviet union also took over the polish provinces east of the curzon line from which 2 million poles were expelled 288 north-east romania 289 290 parts of eastern finland 291 and the three baltic states were also incorporated into the ussr 292 293 in an effort to maintain world peace 294 the allies formed the united nations which officially came into existence on 24 october 1945 295 and adopted the universal declaration of human rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations 296 the great powers that were the victors of the war—france china britain the soviet union and the united states—became the permanent members of the un s security council 7 the five permanent members remain so to the present although there have been two seat changes between the republic of china and the people s republic of china in 1971 and between the soviet union and its successor state the russian federation following the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 the alliance between the western allies and the soviet union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over 297 post-war soviet territorial expansion resulted in central and eastern european border changes the creation of a communist bloc and start of the cold war germany had been de facto divided and two independent states the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic 298 were created within the borders of allied and soviet occupation zones accordingly the rest of europe was also divided into western and soviet spheres of influence 299 most eastern and central european countries fell into the soviet sphere which led to establishment of communist-led regimes with full or partial support of the soviet occupation authorities as a result east germany 300 poland hungary romania czechoslovakia and albania 301 became soviet satellite states communist yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy causing tension with the ussr 302 post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military

unprecedented arms race and proxy wars 304 in asia the united states led the occupation of japan and administrated japan s former islands in the western pacific while the soviets annexed sakhalin and the kuril islands 305 korea formerly under japanese rule was divided and occupied by the soviet union in the north and the us in the south between 1945 and 1948 separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948 each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of korea which led ultimately to the korean war 306 david ben-gurion proclaiming the israeli declaration of independence at the independence hall 14 may 1948 in china nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in june 1946 communist forces were victorious and established the people s republic of china on the mainland while nationalist forces retreated to taiwan in 1949 307 in the middle east the arab rejection of the united nations partition plan for palestine and the creation of israel marked the escalation of the arab–israeli conflict while european powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful leading to decolonisation 308 309 the global economy suffered heavily from the war although participating nations were affected differently the us emerged much richer than any other nation it had a baby boom and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers and it dominated the world economy 310 the uk and us pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in western germany in the years 1945–1948 311 because of international trade interdependencies this led to european economic stagnation and delayed european recovery for several years 312 313 recovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in western germany and was sped up by the liberalisation of european economic policy that the marshall plan 1948–1951 both directly and indirectly caused 314 315 the post-1948 west german recovery has been called the german economic miracle 316 italy also experienced an economic boom 317 and the french economy rebounded 318 by contrast the united kingdom was in a state of economic ruin 319 and although it received a quarter of the total marshall plan assistance more than any other european country 320 continued relative economic decline for decades 321 the soviet union despite enormous human and material losses also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era 322 japan experienced incredibly rapid economic growth becoming one of the most powerful economies in the world by the 1980s 323 china returned to its pre-war industrial production by 1952 324 impact casualties and war

war crimes allied war crimes during world war ii and soviet war crimes world war ii deaths estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary because many deaths went unrecorded most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians 325 326 327 many of the civilians died because of deliberate genocide massacres mass-bombings disease and starvation the soviet union lost around 27 million people during the war 328 including 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths the largest portion of military dead were 5.7 million ethnic russians followed by 1.3 million ethnic ukrainians 329 a quarter of the people in the soviet union were wounded or killed 330 germany sustained 5.3 million military losses mostly on the eastern front and during the final battles in germany 331 of the total number of deaths in world war ii approximately 85 per cent—mostly soviet and chinese—were on the allied side and 15 per cent were on the axis side 332 many of these deaths were caused by war crimes committed by german and japanese forces in occupied territories an estimated 11 333 to 17 million 334 civilians died either as a direct or as an indirect result of nazi racist policies including the holocaust of around 6 million jews half of whom were polish citizens along with a further minimum 1.9 million ethnic poles 335 336 millions of other slavs including russians ukrainians and belarusians roma homosexuals and other ethnic and minority groups were also killed 337 334 hundreds of thousands varying estimates of ethnic serbs along with gypsies and jews were murdered by the axis-aligned croatian ustaše in yugoslavia 338 and retribution-related killings were committed just after the war ended chinese civilians being buried alive by soldiers of the imperial japanese army during the nanking massacre december 1937 in asia and the pacific between 3 million and more than 10 million civilians mostly chinese estimated at 7.5 million 339 were killed by the japanese occupation forces 340 the best-known japanese atrocity was the nanking massacre in which fifty to three hundred thousand chinese civilians were raped and murdered 341 mitsuyoshi himeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the sankō sakusen general yasuji okamura implemented the policy in heipei and shantung 342 axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons the imperial japanese army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of china see unit 731 343 344 and in early conflicts against the soviets 345 both the germans and japanese tested such weapons against civilians 346 and sometimes on prisoners of war 347 the soviet union was responsible for the katyn massacre of 22,000 polish officers 348 and the imprisonment or execution of thousands of political prisoners by the nkvd 349 in the baltic states and eastern poland annexed by the red army the mass-bombing of cities in europe and asia has often been called a war crime however no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during world war ii 350

351 and 4 million others who were deemed unworthy of life including the disabled and mentally ill soviet prisoners of war homosexuals freemasons jehovah s witnesses and romani as part of a programme of deliberate extermination about 12 million most of whom were eastern europeans were employed in the german war economy as forced labourers 352 in addition to nazi concentration camps the soviet gulags labour camps led to the death of citizens of occupied countries such as poland lithuania latvia and estonia as well as german prisoners of war pows and even soviet citizens who had been or were thought to be supporters of the nazis 353 sixty per cent of soviet pows of the germans died during the war 354 richard overy gives the number of 5.7 million soviet pows of those 57 per cent died or were killed a total of 3.6 million 355 soviet ex-pows and repatriated civilians were treated with great suspicion as potential nazi collaborators and some of them were sent to the gulag upon being checked by the nkvd 356 prisoner identity photograph taken by the german ss of a polish girl deported as forced labour to auschwitz december 1942 japanese prisoner-of-war camps many of which were used as labour camps also had high death rates the international military tribunal for the far east found the death rate of western prisoners was 27.1 per cent for american pows 37 per cent 357 seven times that of pows under the germans and italians 358 while 37,583 prisoners from the uk 28,500 from the netherlands and 14,473 from the united states were released after the surrender of japan the number of chinese released was only 56 359 according to historian zhifen ju at least five million chinese civilians from northern china and manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the east asia development board or kōain for work in mines and war industries after 1942 the number reached 10 million 360 the us library of congress estimates that in java between 4 and 10 million rōmusha japanese manual labourers were forced to work by the japanese military about 270,000 of these javanese labourers were sent to other japanese-held areas in south east asia and only 52,000 were repatriated to java 361 on 19 february 1942 roosevelt signed executive order 9066 interning about 100,000 japanese living on the west coast canada had a similar programme 362 363 in addition 14,000 german and italian citizens who had been assessed as being security risks were also interned 364 in accordance with the allied agreement made at the yalta conference millions of pows and civilians were used as forced labour by the soviet union 365 in hungary s case hungarians were forced to work for the soviet union until 1955 366 occupation main articles german-occupied europe lebensraum untermensch collaboration with the axis powers during world war ii resistance during world war ii and nazi plunder polish civilians wearing blindfolds photographed just before their execution by german soldiers in palmiry forest 1940 in europe occupation came under two forms in western northern and central europe france norway denmark the low countries and the annexed portions of czechoslovakia germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks 27.8 billion us dollars by the end of the war this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products military equipment raw materials and other goods 367 thus the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income germany collected from taxation a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total german income as the war went on 368 russian academy of sciences reported in 1995 civilian victims in the soviet union at german hands totalled 13.7 million dead twenty percent of the 68 million persons in the occupied ussr in the east the intended gains of lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the german invaders 369 unlike in the west the nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the inferior people of slavic descent most german advances were thus followed by mass executions 370 although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories they did not significantly hamper german operations in either the east 371 or the west 372 until late 1943 in asia japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere essentially a japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples 373 although japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from european domination in some territories their excessive brutality turned local public opinion against them within weeks 374 during japan s initial conquest it captured 4,000,000 barrels 640,000 m3 of oil 5.5×105 tonnes left behind by retreating allied forces and by 1943 was able to get production in the dutch east indies up to 50 million barrels 6.8×10 6 t 76 per cent of its 1940 output rate 374 home fronts and production main articles military production during world war ii and home front during world war ii allied to axis gdp ratio in europe before the outbreak of the war the allies had significant advantages in both population and economics in 1938 the western allies united kingdom france poland and british dominions had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the european axis powers germany and italy if colonies are included it then gives the allies more than a 5 1 advantage in population and nearly 2 1 advantage in gdp 375 in asia at the same time china had roughly six times the population of japan but only an 89 per cent higher gdp this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher gdp if japanese colonies are included 375 the united states provided about two-thirds of all the ordnance used by the allies in terms of warships transports warplanes artillery tanks trucks and ammunition 376 though the allies economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of germany and japan they became the decisive factor by 1942 after the united states and soviet union joined the allies as the war largely settled into one of attrition 377 while the allies ability to out-produce the axis is often attributed to the allies having more access to natural resources other factors such as germany and japan s reluctance to employ women in the labour force 378 allied strategic bombing 379 and germany s late shift to a war economy 380 contributed significantly additionally neither germany nor japan planned to fight a protracted war and were not equipped to do so 381 to improve their production germany and japan used millions of slave labourers 382 germany used about 12 million people mostly from eastern europe 352 while japan used more than 18 million people in far east asia 360 361 advances in technology and warfare main article technology during world war ii b-29 superfortress strategic bombers on the boeing assembly line in wichita kansas 1944 aircraft were used for reconnaissance as fighters bombers and ground-support and each role was advanced considerably innovation included airlift the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies equipment and personnel 383 and of strategic bombing the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy s ability to wage war 384 anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery such as the german 88 mm gun the use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and though late introduction meant it had little impact it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide 385 advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war actions at taranto pearl harbor and the coral sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship 386 387 388 in the atlantic escort carriers proved to be a vital part of allied convoys increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the mid-atlantic gap 389 carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft 390 and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured 391 submarines which had proved to be an effective weapon during the first world war 392 were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second the british focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics such as sonar and convoys while germany focused on improving its offensive capability with designs such as the type vii submarine and wolfpack tactics 393 gradually improving allied technologies such as the leigh light hedgehog squid and homing torpedoes proved victorious a v-2 rocket launched from a fixed site in peenemünde 21 june 1943 land warfare changed from the static front lines of world war i to increased mobility and combined arms the tank which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the first world war had evolved into the primary weapon 394 in the late 1930s tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during world war i 395 and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed armour and firepower at the start of the war most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications 396 this idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour and german doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat this along with germany s use of combined arms were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across poland and france 394 many means of destroying tanks including indirect artillery anti-tank guns both towed and self-propelled mines short-ranged infantry antitank weapons and other tanks were utilised 396 even with large-scale mechanisation infantry remained the backbone of all forces 397 and throughout the war most infantry were equipped similarly to world war i 398 nuclear gadget being raised to the top of the detonation shot tower at alamogordo bombing range trinity nuclear test new mexico july 1945 the portable machine gun spread a notable example being the german mg34 and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings 398 the assault rifle a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces 399 400 most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines the most well known being the german enigma machine 401 development of sigint signals intelligence and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption notable examples were the allied decryption of japanese naval codes 402 and british ultra a pioneering method for decoding enigma benefiting from information given to britain by the polish cipher bureau which had been decoding early versions of enigma before the war 403 another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception which the allies used to great effect such as in operations mincemeat and bodyguard 402 404 other technological and engineering feats achieved during or as a result of the war include the world s first programmable computers z3 colossus and eniac guided missiles and modern rockets the manhattan project s development of nuclear weapons operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the english channel

million 1769 usd areas affected colombia puerto rico leeward islands part of the 1999 atlantic hurricane season hurricane lenny was the twelfth tropical storm eighth hurricane and record-breaking fifth category 4 hurricane in the 1999 atlantic hurricane season it is the second-strongest november atlantic hurricane on record behind the 1932 cuba hurricane lenny formed on november 13 in the western caribbean sea and maintained an unprecedented west-to-east track for its entire duration it attained hurricane status south of jamaica on november 15 and passed south of hispaniola and puerto rico over the next few days lenny rapidly intensified over the northeastern caribbean on november 17 attaining peak winds of 155 mph 249 km h about 21 mi 34 km south of saint croix in the united states virgin islands it gradually weakened while moving through the leeward islands eventually dissipating on november 23 over the open atlantic ocean before moving through the lesser antilles lenny produced rough surf that killed two people in northern colombia strong winds and rainfall resulted in heavy crop damage in southeastern puerto rico despite the hurricane s passage near saint croix at peak intensity damage on the small island was only described as moderate although there was widespread flooding and erosion damage in the united states territories totaled about 330 million the highest precipitation total was 34.12 in 867 mm at the police station on the french side of saint martin on the island the hurricane killed three people and destroyed more than 200 properties in nearby antigua and barbuda the hurricane killed one person torrential rainfall there contaminated the local water supply significant storm damage occurred as far south as grenada where high surf isolated towns from the capital city meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale hurricane lenny began as a low-pressure area that was first observed in the southwestern caribbean sea on november 8 it developed an area of convection but remained poorly defined for the next few days thunderstorms spread across the region producing heavy rainfall in portions of mexico and central america on november 13 the system became better organized a hurricane hunters flight later that day discovered a surface circulation and winds of about 35 mph 56 km h the data indicated the development of tropical depression sixteen at 1800 utc about 175 mi 282 km south of the cayman islands 1 the depression s convection was fairly disorganized and the national hurricane center nhc did not anticipate any strengthening for three days 2 for much of its existence the tropical cyclone maintained a track from west to east across the caribbean sea which was unprecedented in the atlantic hurricane database earning it the nickname left-hand lenny the path resulted from its movement along the southern end of a trough over the western atlantic ocean 1 after its formation the depression gradually became better organized 3 the nhc upgraded it to tropical storm lenny on november 14 1 based on reports from the hurricane hunters when it was first upgraded to a tropical storm the cyclone already had winds of 65 mph 105 km h and a developing eye feature 4 at 0000 utc on november 15 lenny attained hurricane status about 175 mi 282 km southwest of kingston jamaica 1 the quick intensification was unexpected and occurred after a large area of convection blossomed over the center at the same time lenny developed an anticyclone aloft which provided favorable conditions for the hurricane s development 5 after moving east-southeastward during its initial development stages the hurricane turned more to the east on november 15 the hurricane hunters reported winds of 100 mph 160 km h which indicated that lenny had become a category 2 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale 6 however the cloud pattern subsequently became less organized as the eye disappeared and lenny s winds weakened to 85 mph 137 km h while the hurricane passed south of hispaniola 1 the nhc noted the deterioration could have been due to a disruption of the storm s small inner core by subtle environmental changes after the sudden weakening 7 the hurricane hunters reported that the eye had reformed and the hurricane s winds had reached 100 mph 160 km h at the time a ridge was expected to build to lenny s east and turn the storm northeastward into puerto rico 24 hours later 8 beginning on november 16 hurricane lenny underwent a 24-hour period of rapid deepening reaching major hurricane status about 165 mi 266 km south of the mona passage 1 it developed well-defined banding features good outflow and a circular eye that was visible from the radar in san juan puerto rico 9 the hurricane continued to become better organized with an eye 29 mi 47 km in diameter surrounded by a closed eyewall 10 around 1200 utc on november 17 lenny intensified into a category 4 hurricane while approaching the islands of the northeastern caribbean it was the fifth storm of such intensity in the year setting the record for most category 4 hurricanes in a season 1 the hurricane then made its closest approach to puerto rico passing about 75 mi 121 km southeast of maunabo 11 shortly thereafter lenny attained peak winds of 155 mph 249 km h while passing 21 mi 34 km south of the island of saint croix in the united states virgin islands 1 this made it the second-strongest hurricane on record to form during the month of november 12 hurricane hunters reported lenny s peak winds in the southeastern portion of the hurricane the group also reported a minimum pressure of 933 mbar a drop of 34 mbar in 24 hours in addition a dropsonde recorded winds of 210 mph 340 km h while descending to the surface the highest dropsonde wind speed recording in a hurricane at the time 1 around the time it peaked in intensity lenny s forward speed decreased in response to light steering currents between two ridges despite favorable conditions for strengthening the hurricane weakened as it turned to an eastward drift possibly due to the upwelling of cooler waters late on november 18 lenny s eye moved over saint martin with winds of 125 mph 201 km h after continued weakening the hurricane struck anguilla and saint barthélemy the next day it turned southeastward while still drifting bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands across the northeastern caribbean 1 late on november 19 lenny weakened to tropical storm intensity after increased wind shear exposed the cyclone s center from the deepest convection 1 13 early on november 20 the storm made landfall on anguilla 1 although by then the center had become difficult to locate 14 later that day the cyclone exited the caribbean 15 continuing its southeast track on november 21 lenny turned to the northeast and weakened to a tropical depression 1 the deep convection was located at least 100 mi 160 km east of the increasingly elongated center 16 lenny turned to the east for the final time early on november 22 dissipating the next day about 690 mi 1,110 km east of the lesser antilles 1 preparations edit hurricane lenny south of saint croix early in lenny s duration a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were issued for jamaica later a hurricane watch was issued for the southern coast of hispaniola and a tropical storm warning was also issued for the dominican republic 1 haitian officials declared a state of alert in three southern provinces and allocated about 1 million 1999 usd in hurricane funds 17 residents in flood-prone areas were advised to evacuate in southern haiti and in the neighboring dominican republic 18 19 a hurricane watch was issued for puerto rico and the virgin islands late on november 15 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later 1 by that time lenny was projected to move over puerto rico 8 after lenny made its closest approach to the island the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on november 17 which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the virgin islands 1 in puerto rico the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the san juan national weather service office based on

infrastructure including roads and piers in the tourism-dependent islands most of the islands tourism areas were on western-facing beaches many of which were unprepared for the high waves and winds produced by lenny 28 central caribbean edit early in its existence lenny produced large waves and high tides along the guajira peninsula in colombia 1 sinking two boats and flooding 1,200 houses there were also reports of flooded businesses and damaged crops in the country strong winds on the storm s fringe killed a man by striking him with a beam although there were initial reports of nine people missing 17 only two were counted in the death toll for mainland colombia 1 two sailors were killed offshore when their yacht was lost in the southern caribbean sea 1 along the abc islands off the north coast of venezuela the hurricane produced 10-to-20 ft 3-to-6 m waves along the southwest coastlines 29 the waves caused heavy beach erosion and coastal damage to properties and boats 30 in jamaica the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall but left little damage rains in the dominican republic caused flooding in the country s southwest portion 19 flooding around les cayes in southwestern haiti destroyed 60 percent of the rice corn and banana plantations while high waves wrecked several houses in cavaellon 21 hurricane lenny was originally forecast to strike puerto rico although it remained south of the island 1 beginning on november 17 lenny affected puerto rico with gusty winds and heavy rainfall rainfall in the days prior to lenny s approach left areas susceptible to flooding which caused many rivers in the northeastern portion of the island to overflow their banks following the storm such flooding forced towns to evacuate along the rivers and also resulted in the closure of secondary and primary highways the heavy rains also caused mudslides and rockslides 11 the peak rainfall on the island was 14.64 in 372 mm in jayuya in central puerto rico 31 tides in san juan were about 1.8 ft 0.55 m above normal there high seas washed a 546 ft 166 m freighter ashore winds in the puerto rican mainland were not significant gusting to 48 mph 77 km h in ceiba the storm left

and power lines the winds left severe damage to vegetation after fruits and vegetables were blown away rainfall peaked at 10.47 in 266 mm 31 which caused widespread flooding of many properties in the island s western portion in frederiksted the hurricane produced a storm surge of 15–20 ft 4.6–6.1 m 1 along with high waves that washed out roads and damaged coastal structures there was also severe beach erosion in western st croix high waves dumped 6.5 ft 2.0 m of sand onto coastal roads about 100 ft 30 m inland 11 and also washed several boats ashore 1 the national weather service described the damage as moderate 11 elsewhere in the u.s virgin islands lenny produced a storm surge of about 1.8 ft 0.55 m in st thomas 1 sustained winds on the island reached 53 mph 85 km h at the cyril e king airport with gusts to 70 mph 110 km h on nearby st john wind gusts reached 92 mph 148 km h rains were not as heavy as on st croix the maximum amounts were 4.34 in 110 mm on st thomas and 2.95 in

northwest mexico united states part of the 1982 pacific hurricane season hurricane paul was a particularly deadly and destructive pacific hurricane which killed a total of 1,696 people and caused 1.156 billion in damage the sixteenth named storm and tenth hurricane of the 1982 pacific hurricane season paul developed as a tropical depression just offshore central america on september 18 the depression briefly moved inland two days later just before heading westward out to sea the storm changed little in strength for several days until september 25 when it slowly intensified into a tropical storm two days later paul attained hurricane status and further strengthened to category 2 intensity after turning northward the hurricane then accelerated toward the northeast reaching peak winds of 110 mph 175 km h paul made landfall over baja california sur on september 29 and subsequently moved ashore in sinaloa mexico the next day prior to making landfall near the el salvador–guatemala border as a tropical depression the precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall over nicaragua which later spread into el salvador and guatemala many rivers in the region burst their banks after five days of rainfall causing severe flooding and multiple mudslides throughout central america at least 1,432 people were killed with most of the fatalities occurring in el salvador and guatemala another 225 deaths were attributed to floods from the depression in southern mexico in addition paul was responsible for moderate damage and 24 fatalities in northwestern mexico where it made landfall at hurricane strength meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the precursor disturbance to paul originated from an area of low barometric pressure and disorganized thunderstorms which was first noted near the pacific coast of nicaragua on september 15 several days later satellite imagery indicated it had developed a center of cyclonic circulation on 1800 utc september 20 the eastern pacific hurricane center initiated advisories on the system and classified it as tropical depression twenty-two at that time it was located 200 mi 320 km west of managua nicaragua and supported winds of 35 mph 50 km h the depression turned northward in response to a weak steering flow between two high pressure systems—one near cabo san lucas and the other west of central america it then moved inland near the el salvador–guatemala border and dissipated overland 1 under the influence of a persistent stationary trough near california the remains of the depression retraced westward back over the open waters of the pacific advisories on the system were resumed late on september 20 though it was reconsidered a tropical cyclone its wind circulation was poorly defined the depression again degenerated into an open trough at 0000 utc september 22 its forward motion remained relatively unchanged for several days and by september 24 the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone after briefly drifting northward the system began tracking toward the west-northwest it gradually organized into a tropical storm at 0000 utc september 25 since it was then situated over favorable sea surface temperatures between 28 °c 82 °f and 29 °c 84 °f paul underwent a phase of rapid intensification this allowed it to reach category 1 hurricane strength on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale sshws just two days after its naming 1 upon becoming a hurricane paul turned to the north and continued to develop 1 as the storm neared baja california sur it reached category 2 intensity 2 an upper-level trough forced the hurricane to accelerate towards the northeast at which point it had reached peak wind speeds of 110 mph 180 km h from 1800 to 2100 utc on september 29 the eye of the hurricane made landfall along baja california sur moving ashore less than 100 mi 160 km south of la paz near san josé del cabo after weakening slightly inland paul briefly reemerged over water and subsequently made its final landfall near los mochis sinaloa with winds of 100 mph 165 km h 1 tropical cyclone

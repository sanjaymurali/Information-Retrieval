effect created by james basevi stating it is a hurricane to blast you from the orchestra pit to the first mezzanine it is a hurricane to film your eyes with spin-drift to beat at your ears with its thunder to clutch at your heart and send your diaphragm vaulting over your floating rib into the region just south of your tonsils 2 he complimented the performances of all of the principal actors with the exception of hall whose terangi was described as a competent tarzan 2 nugent also faulted the uneven pacing but in the end characterized the film as one of the most thrilling spectacles the screen has provided this year 2 literary references edit in his memoir la tregua the truce re-titled the reawakening for publication in the u.s primo levi recounted his experience watching the hurricane among other films while he was interned at a soviet transit camp at starye dorogi in the aftermath of world war ii the audience of soviet troops former prisoners of war and holocaust survivors levi included became more and more unruly as the movie progressed culminating in what levi called a witches sabbath when the actual hurricane appeared on screen a fight broke out in the cramped theater and the projectionist decided to shut off the film before the end to levi s dismay he recalled the film as quite a good american film of the thirties remake edit a remake of this movie

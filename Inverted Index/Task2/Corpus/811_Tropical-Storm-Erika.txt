erika of august 2015 was the deadliest natural disaster in dominica since hurricane david in 1979 the fifth named storm of the season erika developed from a westward-moving tropical wave while well east of the lesser antilles hostile conditions including dry air and wind shear inhibited significant development and erika failed to acquire sustained winds beyond 50 mph 85 km h contrary to predictions of a northwesterly recurvature the cyclone persisted on a westerly course and passed through the leeward islands and emerged over the caribbean sea on august 27 erika succumbed to adverse conditions the following day dissipating as a tropical cyclone near the dominican republic the remnant system persisted for several more days ultimately moving across the gulf of mexico before dissipating over georgia on september 2 several islands experienced heavy rainfall during the passage of erika especially dominica the storm s asymmetric structure coupled with the mountainous terrain of the island and ample moisture aloft led to rainfall accumulations up to 33 in 850 mm with grounds already saturated from antecedent rains tremendous runoff quickly overwhelmed river basins and triggered catastrophic floods accompanying mudslides worsened the situation temporarily damming the rivers before collapsing hundreds of homes were left uninhabitable and thousands of people were displaced the entire town of petite savanne was evacuated and subsequently abandoned as a result of the storm all told 30 people died across the island in the nation s worst disaster since hurricane david the storm s devastating effects in dominica prompted an influx of international assistance aid from multiple nations and intergovernmental organizations poured in to assist victims of the storm thousands of homes needed to be built or repaired including 500–1,000 for the relocation of all of petite savanne s residents in guadeloupe heavy rainfall in the vicinity of basse-terre caused flooding and mudslides forcing roads to temporarily close approximately 250,000 people in puerto rico were left without electricity the island experienced us 17.37 million nb 1 in agricultural damage in the dominican republic a weather station in barahona measured 24.26 in 616 mm of rain including 8.8 in 220 mm in a single hour about 823 homes suffered damage and 7,345 people were displaced five people died in haiti four from a weather-related traffic accident and one from a landslide total damage from erika is estimated to be over us 500 million with us 482.8 million in dominica alone owing to the disastrous effects on dominica the name erika was retired in the spring of 2016 and will never again be used for an atlantic tropical cyclone it will be replaced with elsa for the 2021 atlantic hurricane season 1 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on august 20 2015 the national hurricane center nhc began monitoring a tropical wave over western africa near the atlantic shore 2 the disorganized system emerged over the atlantic ocean several hundred miles southeast of the cape verde islands the following day 3 4 moving quickly west the system bypassed the cape verde islands to the south on august 22 5 but remained largely disorganized a sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on august 23 though a well-defined circulation did not consolidate 3 organization of the low improved throughout the day as environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis 6 the trough acquired gale-force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 18 00 utc the formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone accordingly the system was classified as tropical storm erika the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season upon its designation erika was situated roughly 1,035 mi 1,665 km east of the lesser antilles 3 the storm maintained a brisk westward trajectory steered by a subtropical ridge to the north 3 7 at the time of erika s classification forecast models diverged significantly on the potential future of erika statistical guidance and the hwrf depicted a hurricane while the ecmwf and gfs showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear the models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course accordingly the nhc noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for erika 7 this uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones but roughly average for weak poorly organized systems 8 throughout august 25 and into early august 26 the convective organization of erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection 9 early on august 27 erika managed to intensify slightly attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph 85 km h and a barometric pressure of 1001 mbar hpa 29.56 inhg 3 around 09 00 utc the disorganized center of erika passed over the northern tip of guadeloupe before emerging over the eastern caribbean sea 3 official forecast positions top left and various forecast models for erika versus its best track positions black lines note the consistent northerly bias present in all outputs convection remained poorly organized and mostly confined to eastern portions of the cyclone as it traversed the eastern caribbean sea 10 multiple circulation centers were noted during the overnight of august 27–28 all rotating around a broad general center one such center moved over st croix and produced gale-force gusts environmental conditions ahead of the storm became increasingly hostile and forecasters at the nhc continued to note unusually high uncertainty in their forecasts 11 further structural degradation ensued on august 28 as erika approached the dominican republic based on data from hurricane hunters erika degenerated into a broad area of low pressure—no longer meeting the definition of a tropical cyclone—shortly after 12 00 utc near the southeastern coast of the dominican republic 3 operationally the nhc maintained advisories on erika until 13 30 utc on august 29 12 it was also noted during those advisories that the center was completely devoid of convection and whatever convection remained was reduced to the eastern half of the system 13 around 21 00 utc on august 28 the remnants of erika made landfall along the southeastern coast of the dominican republic 14 the disheveled system emerged over the windward passage early on august 29 13 thereafter the system skirted the northern coast of cuba and entered the gulf of mexico on august 31 turning northward the disturbance eventually crossed northern florida on september 2 before dissipating over georgia the following day 3

accompanied these storms downing trees and power lines in cherokee polk and troup counties 45 46 47 additional rainfall extended north through the carolinas 41 effects in dominica edit the rugged terrain of dominica makes it prone to landslides in heavy rain events the town of petite savanne pictured situated on steep cliffs was rendered uninhabitable after numerous landslides devastated the area although erika passed to the north of dominica as a weak tropical storm torrential rains associated with the storm impacted the country 3 unusually high precipitable water values of 2.6 in 67 mm were present over the island as erika moved through orographic influence exacerbated rainfall rates and this was further compounded with the formation of a temporary mesoscale low over the island as the primary circulation of erika continued west more than 8 in 200 mm of rain fell across the entire island in less than 48 hours with an island-wide average of 24 in 610 mm nb 2 during the period of

airport and 8.74 in 222 mm at douglas–charles airport 3 with grounds already saturated from nearly two weeks of rain prior to erika much of the precipitation did not penetrate the surface in multiple watersheds runoff exceeded 60 percent of accumulations 48 catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides ensued across the island 3 resulting in dominica s worst natural disaster since hurricane david in 1979 50 51 across the island s rugged terrain the mudslides temporarily dammed overflowing rivers creating a buildup of water these earthen dams subsequently collapsed leading to amplified flooding downstream flow rates in these localized events vastly exceeded values expected by international commission on large dams modeling a post-storm study of 16 rivers on the island revealed peak discharge values in excess of 1,000 m3 s along 5 rivers with a maximum of 2,876 m3 s along the malabuka river 48 nearly 17,000 of the nation s 71,293 people were severely impacted by the storm 52 a total of

petite savanne was virtually destroyed with 217 homes leveled and all residents forced to evacuate 63 64 twenty people died or were presumed dead in the village accounting for two-thirds of the deaths attributed to erika in dominica 3 65 residents dug through mud and debris often with their bare hands to rescue those trapped and in many cases did so with nearby homes on the verge of collapse 57 the village was isolated for several days and residents buried victims before help arrived 66 local response edit immediately following erika s devastating impact in dominica on august 27 the organisation

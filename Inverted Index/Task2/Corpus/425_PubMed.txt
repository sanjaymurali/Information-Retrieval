translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names relevant mesh medical subject headings terms synonyms boolean operators and nests the resulting terms appropriately enhancing the search formulation significantly in particular by routinely combining using the or operator textwords and mesh terms the examples given in a pubmed tutorial 10 demonstrate how this automatic process works causes sleep walking is translated as etiology subheading or etiology all fields or causes all fields or causality mesh terms or causality all fields and somnambulism mesh terms or somnambulism all fields or sleep all fields and walking all fields or sleep walking all fields likewise heart attack aspirin prevention is translated as myocardial infarction mesh terms or

match publication date first author last author journal or title 12 comprehensive searches edit for optimal searches in pubmed it is necessary to understand its core component medline and especially of the mesh medical subject headings controlled vocabulary used to index medline articles they may also require complex search strategies use of field names tags proper use of limits and other features reference librarians and search specialists offer search services 13 14 journal article parameters edit when a journal article is indexed numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information such parameters are article type mesh terms e.g. clinical trial secondary identifiers mesh terms language country of the journal or publication history e-publication date print journal publication date publication type clinical queries systematic reviews edit publication type parameter allows searching by the type of publication including reports of various kinds of clinical research 15 secondary id edit since july 2005 the medline article indexing process extracts identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called secondary identifier si the secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial ids for clinical trials pubmed extracts trial ids for the two largest trial registries clinicaltrials.gov nct identifier and the international standard randomized controlled trial number register irctn identifier 16

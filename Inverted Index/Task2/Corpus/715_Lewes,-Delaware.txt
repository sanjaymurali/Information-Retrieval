zwaanendael swan valley 7 the colony had a short existence as a local tribe of lenape native americans wiped out the 32 settlers in 1632 the area remained rather neglected by the dutch until under the threat of annexation from the english colony of maryland the city of amsterdam made a grant of land at the hoernkills the area around cape henlopen near the current town of lewes to a group of mennonites for settlement in 1662 a total of 35 men were to be included in the settlement led by a pieter cornelisz plockhoy of zierikzee and funded by a sizable loan from the city to get them established the settlement was established in 1663 but the timing of the settlement was terrible in 1664 the english wrested new netherland from the dutch and they had the settlement destroyed with british reports indicating that “not even a nail” was left there 8 the area was slow to resettle but a new settlement gradually regrew around the hoernkills in late december 1673 when the area was briefly held again by the dutch the settlement was attacked and burned down again by soldiers from the english colony of maryland in 1680 under the authority of james stuart duke of york who had been

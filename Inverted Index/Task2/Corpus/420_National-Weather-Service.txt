spring maryland employees 5,000 3 annual budget 1,124,149,000 4 agency executive louis uccellini director parent agency noaa child agency national centers for environmental prediction website www.weather.gov the national weather service nws is an agency of the united states federal government that is tasked with providing weather forecasts warnings of hazardous weather and other weather-related products to organizations and the public for the purposes of protection safety and general information it is a part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa branch of the department of commerce and is headquartered in silver spring maryland located just outside washington d.c 5 6 the agency was known as the united states weather bureau from 1890 until it adopted its current name in 1970 7 the nws performs its primary task through a collection of national and regional centers and 122 local weather forecast offices wfos as the nws is a government agency most of its products are in the public domain and available free of charge history edit nws hq in silver spring maryland in 1870 the weather bureau of the united states was established through a joint resolution of congress signed by president ulysses s grant 8 with a mission to provide for taking meteorological observations at the military stations in the interior of the continent and at other points in the states and territories...and for giving notice on the northern great lakes and on the seacoast by magnetic telegraph and marine signals of the approach and force of storms the agency was placed under the secretary of war as congress felt military discipline would probably secure the greatest promptness regularity and accuracy in the required observations within the department of war it was assigned to the u.s army signal service under brigadier general albert j myer general myer gave the national weather service its first name the division of telegrams and reports for the benefit of commerce 9 cleveland abbe – who began developing probabilistic forecasts using daily weather data sent by the cincinnati chamber of commerce and western union which he convinced to back the collection of such information in 1869 – was appointed as the bureau s first chief meteorologist in his earlier role as the civilian assistant to the chief of the signal service abbe urged the department of war to research weather conditions to provide a scientific basis behind the forecasts he would continue to urge the study of meteorology as a science after becoming weather bureau chief while a debate went on between the signal service and congress over whether the forecasting of weather conditions should be handled by civilian agencies or the signal service s existing forecast office a congressional committee was formed to oversee the matter recommending that the office s operations be transferred to the department of war following a two-year investigation 10 the agency first became a civilian enterprise in 1890 when it became part of the department of agriculture under the oversight of that branch the bureau began issuing flood warnings and fire weather forecasts and output the first daily national surface weather maps it also established a network to distribute warnings for tropical cyclones as well as a data exchange service that relayed european weather analysis to the bureau and vice versa 11 the first weather bureau radiosonde was launched in massachusetts in 1937 which prompted a switch from routine aircraft observation to radiosondes within two years the bureau prohibited the word tornado from being used in any of its weather products out of concern for inciting panic a move contradicted in its intentions by the high death tolls in past tornado outbreaks due to the lack of advanced warning until 1938 when it began disseminating tornado warnings exclusively to emergency management personnel 12 the bureau would later be moved to the department of commerce in 1940 13 on july 12 1950 bureau chief francis w reichelderfer officially lifted the agency s ban on public tornado alerts in a circular letter noting to all first order stations that weather bureau employees should avoid statements that can be interpreted as a negation of the bureau s willingness or ability to make tornado forecasts and that a good probability of verification exist when issuing such forecasts due to the difficulty in accurately predicting tornadic activity 14 however it would not be until it faced criticism for continuing to refuse to provide public tornado warnings and preventing the release of the usaf severe weather warning center s tornado forecasts pioneered in 1948 by air force capt robert c miller and major ernest fawbush beyond military personnel that the bureau issued its first experimental public tornado forecasts in march 1952 12 in 1957 the bureau began using radars for short-term forecasting of local storms and hydrological events using modified versions of those used by navy aircraft to create the wsr-57 weather surveillance radar 1957 with a network of wsr systems being deployed nationwide through the early 1960s 15 some of the radars were upgraded to wsr-74 models beginning in 1974 the weather bureau became part of the environmental science services administration when that agency was formed in august 1966 the environmental science services administration was renamed the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa on october 1 1970 with the enactment of the national environmental policy act at this time the weather bureau became the national weather service 8 nexrad next generation radar a system of doppler radars deployed to improve the detection and warning time of severe local storms replaced the wsr-57 and wsr-74 systems between 1988 and 1997 16 17 bob glahn has written a comprehensive history of the first hundred years of the national weather service 18 19 forecast sub-organizations edit sample maximum temperature map from the ndfd the nws through a variety of sub-organizations issues different forecasts to users including the general public although throughout history text forecasts have been the means of product dissemination the nws has been using more forecast products of a digital gridded image or other modern format 20 each of the 122 weather forecast offices wfos send their graphical forecasts to a national server to be compiled in the national digital forecast database ndfd 21 the ndfd is a collection of common weather observations used by organizations and the public including precipitation amount temperature and cloud cover among other parameters in addition to viewing gridded weather data via the internet users can download and use the individual grids using a grib2 decoder which can output data as shapefiles netcdf grads float files and comma separated variable files 22 specific points in the digital database can be accessed using an xml soap service fire weather edit see also wildfire the national weather service issues many products relating to wildfires daily for example a fire weather forecast which have a forecast period covering up to seven days is issued by local weather forecast offices wfos daily with updates as needed the forecasts contain weather information relevant to fire control and smoke management for the next 12 to 48 hours such as wind direction and speed and precipitation the appropriate crews use this information to plan for staffing and equipment levels the ability to conduct scheduled controlled burns and assess the daily fire danger once per day nws meteorologists issue a coded fire weather forecast for specific united states forest service observation sites that are then input into the national fire danger rating system nfdrs this computer model outputs the daily fire danger that is then conveyed to the public in one of five ratings low moderate high very high or extreme 23 the local weather forecast offices of the nws also under a prescribed set of criteria issue fire weather watches and red flag warnings as needed in addition to issuing the daily fire weather forecasts for the local service area these products alert the public and other agencies to conditions which create the potential for extreme fires on the national level the nws storm prediction center issues fire weather analyses for days one and two of the forecast period that provide supportive information to the local wfo forecasts regarding particular critical elements of fire weather conditions these include large-scale areas that may experience critical fire weather conditions including the occurrence of dry thunderstorms which usually occur in the western u.s. and are not accompanied by any rain due to it evaporating before reaching the surface 24 nws imet taking observations in the field state and federal forestry officials sometimes request a forecast from a wfo for a specific location called a spot forecast which are used to determine whether it will be safe to ignite a prescribed burn and how to situate crews during the controlling phase officials send in a request usually during the early morning containing the position coordinates of the proposed burn the ignition time and other pertinent information the wfo composes a short-term fire weather forecast for the location and sends it back to the officials usually within an hour of receiving the request 24 the nws assists officials at the scene of large wildfires or other disasters including hazmat incidents by providing on-site support through incident meteorologists imet 25 imets are nws forecasters specially trained to work with incident management teams during severe wildfire outbreaks or other disasters requiring on-site weather support imets travel quickly to the incident site and then assemble a mobile weather center capable of providing continuous meteorological support for the duration of the incident the kit includes a cell phone a laptop computer and communications equipment used for gathering and displaying weather data such as satellite imagery or numerical forecast model output remote weather stations are also used to gather specific data for the point of interest 25 and often receive direct support from the local wfo during such crises imets approximately 70 to 80 of which are employed nationally can be deployed anywhere a disaster strikes and must be capable of working long hours for weeks at a time in remote locations under rough conditions weather forecast offices edit see also list of national weather service weather forecast offices the national weather service uses local branches known as weather forecast offices or wfos to issue products specific to those areas each wfo maintains a specific area of responsibility spanning multiple counties parishes or other jurisdictions within the continental united states – which in some areas cover multiple states – or individual possessions the local offices handle responsibility of composing and disseminating forecasts and weather alerts to areas within their region of service some of the products that are only issued by the wfos are severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings flood flash flood and winter weather watches and warnings some aviation products and local forecast grids the forecasts issued by a wfo are available on their individual pages within the weather.gov website which can be accessed through either forecast landing pages which identify the office that disseminates the weather data or via the alert map

meteorologists preparing a forecast early 20th century the nws supports the aviation community through the production of several forecasts each area s wfo has responsibility for the issuance of terminal aerodrome forecasts tafs for airports in their jurisdiction 26 tafs are concise coded 24-hour forecasts 30-hour forecasts for certain airports for a specific airport which are issued every six hours with amendments as needed as opposed to a public weather forecast a taf only addresses weather elements critical to aviation these include wind visibility cloud cover and wind shear twenty-one nws center weather service units cwsu are collocated with the federal aviation administration faa air route traffic control centers artcc their main responsibility is to provide up-to-the-minute weather information and briefings to the traffic management units and control room supervisors special emphasis is given to weather conditions that could be hazardous to aviation or impede the flow of air traffic in the national airspace system beside scheduled and unscheduled briefings for decision-makers in the artcc and other faa facilities cwsu meteorologists also issue two unscheduled products the center weather advisory cwa is an aviation weather warning for thunderstorms icing turbulence and low cloud ceilings and visibilities the meteorological impact statement mis is a two to 12-hour forecast that outlines weather conditions expected to impact artcc operations 27 the aviation weather center awc located in kansas city missouri is a central aviation support facility operated by the national weather service which issues two primary products airmet airmen s meteorological information – information on icing turbulence mountain obscuration low-level wind

prediction center spc in norman oklahoma issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches in cooperation with local wfos which are responsible for delineating jurisdictions affected by the issued watch and spc also issues mesoscale discussions focused upon possible convective activity spc compiles reports of severe hail wind or tornadoes issued by local wfos each day when thunderstorms producing such phenomena occur in a given area and formats the data into text and graphical products it also provides forecasts on convective activity through day eight of the forecast period most prominently the threat of severe thunderstorms the risk of which is assessed through a tiered system conveyed among six categories – general thunderstorms marginal slight enhanced moderate or high – based mainly on the expected number of storm reports and regional coverage of thunderstorm activity over a given forecast day and is responsible for issuing fire weather outlooks which support local wfos in the determination of the need for red flag warnings weather prediction center edit main article weather prediction center the weather prediction center in college park maryland provides guidance for future precipitation amounts and areas where excessive rainfall is likely 28 while local nws offices are responsible for issuing flood watches flash flood watches flood warnings flash flood warnings and flood advisories for their local county warning area as well as the official rainfall forecast for areas within their warning area of responsibility these products can and do emphasize different hydrologic issues depending on geographic area land use time of year as well as other meteorological and non-meteorological factors for example during the early spring or late winter a flood warning can be issued for an ice jam that occurs on a river while in the summer a flood warning will most likely be issued for excessive rainfall national ahps map in recent years the nws has enhanced its dissemination of hydrologic information through the advanced hydrologic prediction service ahps 29 the ahps allows anyone to view near real-time observation and forecast data for rivers lakes and streams the service also enables the nws to provide long-range probabilistic information which can be used for long-range planning decisions river forecast centers edit daily river forecasts are issued by the thirteen river forecast centers rfcs using hydrologic models based on rainfall soil characteristics precipitation forecasts and several other variables the first such center was founded on september 23 1946 30 some rfcs especially those in mountainous regions also provide seasonal snow pack and peak flow forecasts these forecasts are used by a wide range of users including those in

climate prediction center the climate prediction center cpc in college park maryland is responsible for all of the nws s climate-related forecasts their mission is to serve the public by assessing and forecasting the impacts of short-term climate variability emphasizing enhanced risks of weather-related extreme events for use in mitigating losses and maximizing economic gains their products cover time scales from a week to seasons extending into the future as far as technically feasible and cover the land the ocean and the atmosphere extending into the stratosphere most of the products issued by the center cover the contiguous u.s and alaska additionally weather forecast offices issue daily and monthly climate reports for official climate stations within their area of responsibility these generally include recorded highs lows and other information including historical temperature extremes fifty-year temperature and precipitation averages and degree days this information is considered preliminary until certified by the national climatic data center data acquisition edit surface observations edit an automated surface observing system asos the primary network of surface weather observation stations in the united states is composed of automated surface observing systems asos the asos program is a joint effort of the national weather service nws the federal aviation administration faa and the department of defense dod 32 asos stations are designed to support weather forecast activities and aviation operations and at the same time support the needs of the meteorological hydrological and climatological research communities asos was especially designed for the safety of the aviation community therefore the sites are almost always located near airport runways the system transmits routine hourly observations along with special observations when conditions exceed aviation weather thresholds e.g conditions change from visual meteorological conditions to instrument meteorological conditions the basic weather elements observed are sky condition visibility present weather obstructions to vision pressure temperature dew point wind direction and speed

frequently and from more locations is the key to improving forecasts and warnings due to the large installation and operating costs associated with asos the stations are widely spaced therefore the cooperative observer program coop a network of approximately 11,000 mostly volunteer weather observers provides much of the meteorological and climatological data to the country the program which was established in 1890 under the organic act currently has a twofold mission provide observational meteorological data usually consisting of daily maximum and minimum temperatures snowfall and 24-hour precipitation totals required to define the climate of the united states and to help measure long-term climate changes provide observational meteorological data in near real-time to support forecast warning and other public service programs of the nws the national weather service also maintains connections with privately operated mesonets such as the citizen weather observer program for data collection in part through the meteorological assimilated data ingest system madis funding is also provided to the cocorahs volunteer weather observer network through parent agency noaa marine observations edit see also weather buoy and weather ship 3-metre 9.8 ft discus buoy located off the southeast u.s coast nws forecasters need frequent high-quality marine observations to examine conditions for forecast preparation and to verify their forecasts after they are produced these observations are especially critical to the output of numerical weather models because large bodies of water have a profound impact on the weather other users rely on the observations and forecasts for commercial and recreational activities to help meet these needs the nws s national data buoy center ndbc in hancock county mississippi operates a network of about 90 buoys and 60 land-based coastal observing systems c-man the stations measure wind speed direction and gust barometric pressure and air temperature in addition all buoy and some c-man stations measure sea surface temperature and wave height and period 33 conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations all stations report on an hourly basis supplemental weather observations are acquired through the united states voluntary observing ship vos program 34 it is organized for the purpose of obtaining weather and oceanographic observations from transiting ships an international program under world meteorological organization wmo marine auspices the vos has 49 countries as participants the united states program is the largest in the world with nearly 1,000 vessels observations are taken by deck officers coded in a special format known as the ships synoptic code and transmitted in real-time to the nws they are then distributed on national and international circuits for use by meteorologists in weather forecasting by oceanographers ship routing services fishermen and many others the observations are then forwarded for use by the national climatic data center ncdc in asheville north carolina upper air observations edit a radiosonde shortly after launch upper air weather data is essential for weather forecasting and research the nws operates 92 radiosonde locations in north america and ten sites in the caribbean a small expendable instrument package is suspended below a 2 metres 6.6 ft wide balloon filled with hydrogen or helium then released daily at or shortly after 1100 and 2300 utc respectively as the radiosonde rises at about 300 meters minute 1,000 ft min sensors on the radiosonde measure profiles of pressure temperature and relative humidity these sensors are linked to a battery-powered radio transmitter that sends the sensor measurements to a ground receiver by tracking the position of the radiosonde in flight information on wind speed and direction aloft is also obtained the flight can last longer than two hours and during this time the radiosonde can ascend above 35 km 115,000 ft and drift more than 200 km 120 mi from the release point when the balloon has expanded beyond its elastic limit and bursts about 6 m or 20 ft in diameter a small parachute slows the descent of the radiosonde minimizing the danger to lives and property data obtained during the flights is coded and disseminated at which point it can be plotted on a skew-t or stuve diagram for analysis in recent years the national weather service has begun incorporating data from amdar in its numerical models however the raw data is not available to the public event-driven products edit main article severe weather terminology united states the national weather service has developed a multi-tier concept for forecasting or alerting the public to all types of hazardous weather outlook – hazardous weather outlooks are issued daily by individual weather forecast offices to address potentially hazardous weather or hydrologic events that may occur over the next seven days the outlook will include information about the potential of convective thunderstorm activity including the potential for severe thunderstorms heavy rain or flooding winter weather and extremes of heat or cold it is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event including notification to storm spotter groups and local emergency management agencies on the recommendation of activation during severe weather situations in areas prone to such events other outlooks are issued on an event-driven basis such as the flood potential outlook and severe weather outlook advisory – an advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring imminent or likely advisories are for less serious conditions than warnings that cause significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised could lead to situations that may threaten life or property watch – a watch is used when the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly but its occurrence location or timing is still uncertain it is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their safety plans in motion can do so in advance if a forecasted event should occur a watch means that hazardous weather is possible but not imminent people should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and monitor various avenues that provide noaa-disseminated data to listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities warning – a warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring imminent or likely a warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property people in the path of the storm need to take protective action special weather statement or significant weather advisory – a special weather statement is issued when something rare or unusual is occurring these are usually triggered by sudden changes in meteorological conditions the statements are to be taken as warnings for residents of a specific area significant weather advisories are often issued for storms not severe enough for severe thunderstorm warnings but for strong winds and small hail the warning generally states that an area might be at risk for a slight weather danger though not all weather statements are warnings other times statements describe informative facts about a weather system such as local snowfall weather warnings and advisories edit main article severe weather terminology united states short-fused weather warnings and advisories issued by local nws forecast offices are generally less than 500–5,000 square miles 1,300–12,900 km2 in area warnings for severe local storms are intended to be issued preceding the arrival of severe weather at a particular locale by one hour or less the nws also issues warnings and advisories for various hydrological and non-hydrological events including floods non-thunderstorm high winds winter storms intense heat or cold fire weather and marine hazards which vary in timepsan depending on the weather situation inland and coastal warnings for tropical cyclones are issued by the national hurricane center nhc a guidance center of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the nws defines a warning as a hazardous weather or hydrologic event that is occurring is imminent or has a very high probability of occurring and an advisory as highlighting special weather conditions that are less serious than a warning . for events that may cause significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised could lead to situations that may threaten life and or property 35 36 in earnest they indicate that hazardous weather conditions are occurring that may pose a risk to life and property and are intended to direct the general public to take immediate action and heed safety precautions it also has the side purpose of directing emergency management personnel to be on standby in case the weather situation leads to property damage or casualties severe thunderstorm and flood warnings indicate that organized severe thunderstorms or flooding are occurring whereas tornado warnings are issued if a storm is indicated to be producing an observed tornado or exhibits strong low-level rotation 37 the process of issuing a warning or advisory begins with observations of a hydrological or extreme weather event that is either occurring at present through radar imagery reports from local television and radio stations or ground observations by local law enforcement civil defense officials media outlets or storm spotters or is forecast to occur within 12 to 24 hours if after collaboration a warning or advisory is deemed necessary the weather forecast office will generate a bulletin product via the advance weather interactive processing system awips and then disseminate the alert through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies on the internet to noaa satellites and on noaa weather radio 38 the product outlines the alert type the issuing wfo the sections of government subdivisions county parish or boroughs covered by the alert and its time of expiration based on the local time zone some products – particularly for severe thunderstorm tornado and flood warnings – include a tag requesting emergency alert system activation to trigger public alert messages via television radio stations noaa weather radio and smartphone apps and messaging services for local storm events the warning or advisory product also outlines a meteorological summary of the most recent storm location or local storm report issued prior to the product s issuance including the approximate area in statute miles and estimated speed and direction associated hazards impacts municipalities and designated land areas and if applicable highway mile markers covered by the alert and boilerplate action messages informing the public of safety precautions they need to take or advising them to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local national weather service office a statement may be issued as a follow-up message to a warning watch or emergency which may update extend or cancel the previously issued product or be used as a notification of significant weather for which no type of alert is currently in effect for a given location or is expected to be in effect in situations where a forecaster indicates a significant threat of extremely severe and life-threatening weather with an ongoing local weather event enhanced wording may be used to note the heightened threat by a significant local storm event in april 2012 the nws introduced the impact based warning system at its weather forecast offices in wichita and topeka kansas and springfield st louis and kansas city pleasant hill missouri the pilot project – which would expand to 80 weather forecast offices overseen by the central eastern southern and western region headquarters by the spring of 2015 – incorporate message tags within the main body of the product describing the source of the hazard report damage potential and if applicable radar indications or physical observations of tornadoes or the possibility of a tornado hazards are also summarized at the close of the product text describing estimated maximum hail size and wind gusts and if applicable if a storm has the potential to produce a tornado or in the event of a tornado warning the basis of the warning or its damage threat 39 40 41 42 the wording particularly dangerous situation pds which originated by the storm prediction center for use in tornado watch products during expected high-end severe weather outbreaks is subjectively issued 43 it is occasionally issued with tornado warnings normally if a large tornado capable of producing ef3 to ef5 damage or staying on the ground for long-duration – sometimes uninterrupted – paths has been reported although a tornado emergency may be issued in such cases if the tornado is expected to track into a densely populated area 43 pds warnings for other alerts occur with even less frequency and their criteria varies depending on the alert type to which the wording is applied 43 until september 30 2007 local offices of the national weather service issued warnings for severe thunderstorms tornadoes flash flooding and marine hazards using geopolitical boundaries the implementation of storm-based warnings on october 1 2007 saw alerts for these meteorological or hydrological threats be delineated by polygonal shapes in map-based weather hazard products which outline the specified sections of government sub-jurisdictions that the warning covers based on the projected path of a storm as determined by doppler radar at the time of the warning s issuance however entire counties parishes may sometimes be included in the warning polygon especially if they encompass a small geographical area 44 warnings can be expanded contracted by removing jurisdictions where spc and nws forecasters no longer consider there to be a viable threat of severe weather in which case the storm-based warning may take on a trapezoidal representation in map-based watch products or canceled before their set time of expiration by local nws offices the nws also releases experimental severe weather impact products for use on social media accounts maintained by local forecast offices as well as the enhanced data display edd an experimental pilot project created by the charleston west virginia office s weatherready nation initiative the product provides a graphical depiction of short-fuse warnings and watches specifically tornado and severe thunderstorm watches and warnings and flash flood warnings showing a map of the warning area outlined as a red polygon and locations including communities and interstate highways that will be impacted for severe thunderstorm tornado and flash flood warnings the estimated population count of the warned area and approximate totals of public schools and hospitals within the warning area as well as the maximum forecast intensity of hail size wind gusts and potential tornadoes tornado warnings referenced in the impact product also denote whether the warning was issued based on radar indication or ground confirmation 45 product dissemination edit this section does not cite any sources please

all hazards nwr promoted as the voice of the national weather service is a special radio system that transmits weather forecasts and alerts 24 hours a day across most of the united states the system – which is owned and operated by the nws – consists of more than 1,000 transmitters covering all 50 states adjacent coastal waters puerto rico the u.s virgin islands and the u.s pacific territories of american samoa guam and the northern mariana islands nwr requires a special radio receiver or scanner capable of picking up the signal individual nwr stations broadcast any one of seven allocated frequencies centered on 162 mhz known collectively as weather band in the vhf radio frequency band in recent years national emergency response agencies such as the federal emergency management agency fema and the department of homeland security have begun to take advantage of nwr s ability to efficiently reach a large portion of the u.s population when necessary the system can also be used in conjunction with the emergency alert system to broadcast civil natural and technological emergency and disaster alerts and information in addition to those related to weather – hence the addition of the phrasing all hazards to the name the noaa weather wire service nwws is a satellite data collection and dissemination system operated by the national weather service which was established in october 2000 its purpose is to provide state and federal government commercial users media and private citizens with timely delivery of meteorological hydrological climatological and geophysical

of responsibility weather.gov superseded the interactive weather information network iwin the agency s early internet service which provided nws data from the 1990s through the mid-2000s since 1983 the nws has provided external user access to weather information obtained by or derived from the u.s government through a collection of data communication line services called the family of services fos which is accessible via dedicated telecommunications access lines in the washington d.c. area all fos data services are driven by the nws telecommunication gateway computer systems located at nws headquarters in silver spring maryland users may obtain any of the individual services from nws for a one-time connection charge and an annual user fee technology edit a nws composite radar image of the continental united states composed of many regional radars the wsr-88d doppler weather radar system also called nexrad was developed by the national weather service during the mid-1980s and fully deployed throughout the majority of the united states by 1997 there are 158 such radar sites in operation in the u.s. its various territorial possessions and selected overseas locations this technology because of its high resolution and ability to detect intra-cloud motions is now the cornerstone of the agency s severe weather warning operations national weather service meteorologists use an advanced information processing display and telecommunications system the advance weather interactive processing system awips to complete their work these workstations allow them to easily view a multitude of weather and hydrologic information as well as compose and disseminate products the nws environmental modeling center was one of the early users of the esmf common modeling infrastructure the global forecast system gfs is one of the applications that is built on the framework in 2016 the nws significantly increased the computational power of its supercomputers spending 44 million on two new supercomputers from cray and ibm this was driven by relatively lower accuracy of nws global forecast system gfs numerical weather prediction model compared to other global weather models 46 47 this was most notable in the gfs model incorrectly predicting hurricane sandy turning out to sea until four days before landfall while the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts model predicted landfall correctly at seven days the new supercomputers increased computational processing power from 776 teraflops to 5.78 petaflops 48 49 50 organization edit typical forecast office wfo

university of washington professor cliff mass 53 have pointed out that nws forecasts are not as accurate as they could be and that this has resulted in inaccurate daily weather forecasts and dangerously bad predictions concerning the location and intensity of extreme weather events like blizzards and hurricanes certain private companies the british met office the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts ecmwf and the northwest regional modeling consortium in seattle have been cited as producing more accurate predictions in certain circumstances according to critics causes include 54 lack of sufficient computing power to run simulations known to be better including higher-resolution simulations and ensemble forecasts where multiple runs tweak variables slightly to detect low-confidence simulations not using techniques shown to improve accuracy by recent academic research not assimilating data from all available sources such as tamdar data from commercial airliners due to budget cuts this could not be purchased from panasonic weather solutions on an ongoing basis lack of updated equipment on weather satellites lack of focus on a small number of high-quality models compared to the met office and the ecmwf integrated forecast system organizational stovepiping and turf wars resistance to change by powerful employee unions the next generation global prediction system project at nws aims to address some of these criticisms by running a unified high-quality model that takes advantage of more recent research results 55 privatization and dismantling attempts edit while respected as one of the premier weather organizations in the world the national weather service has been perceived by some conservatives as competing unfairly with the private sector 56 national weather service forecasts and data being works of the federal government are in the public domain and thus available to anyone for free in accordance with united states law from time to time the situation receives official review to ascertain if a leaner more efficient approach may be had by some degree of privatization aborted byrne proposal edit in 1983 under the administration of president ronald reagan noaa administrator john v byrne announced a proposal to sell all of the agency s weather satellites at auction with the intent to repurchase the weather data from private contractors that would acquire the satellites under the proposal 30 of noaa s workforce would be reviewed for potential layoffs and certain specialty forecasts of agricultural and economic importance would be eliminated noaa also proposed outsourcing of weather observation stations noaa weather radio and computerized surface analysis to private companies the proposal was met with negative reaction among the public members of congress and consumer advocacy groups including most notably ralph nader objecting to the possibility of weather information intended for the public domain being sold to private entities that would profit from the sale of the data the proposal to sell the satellite network failed in a congressional vote while other aspects of the proposal to dismantle portions of noaa s agencies were eventually scuttled 57 failed santorum proposal edit main article national weather service duties act of 2005 in 2005 pennsylvania senator rick santorum introduced the national weather service duties act of 2005 58 a bill which would have prohibited the nws from freely distributing weather data the bill was widely criticized by users of the nws s services especially by emergency management officials who rely on the national weather service for information during situations such as fires flooding or severe weather groups such as the aircraft owners and pilots association condemned the bill s restrictions on weather forecasting as threatening the safety of air traffic noting that 40 of all aviation accidents are at least partially weather-related 59 the bill attracted no cosponsors and died in committee during the 2005 congressional session no subsequent attempts have been made to restrict nws forecasts

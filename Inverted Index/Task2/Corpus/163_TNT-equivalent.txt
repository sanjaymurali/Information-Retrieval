template message diagram of explosive yield vs mushroom cloud height illustrating the difference between 22 kiloton fat man and 15 megaton castle bravo explosions citation needed tnt equivalent is a convention for expressing energy typically used to describe the energy released in an explosion the ton of tnt is a unit of energy defined by that convention to be 4.184 gigajoules 1 which is the approximate energy released in the detonation of a metric ton 1,000 kilograms or one megagram of tnt the convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of conventional explosive materials of which tnt is a typical example although other conventional explosives such as dynamite contain more energy kiloton and megaton edit the kiloton of tnt is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 terajoules the megaton of tnt is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 petajoules the kiloton and megaton of tnt have traditionally been used to describe the energy output and hence the destructive power of a nuclear weapon the tnt equivalent appears in various nuclear weapon control treaties and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an asteroid impact 2 historical derivation of the value edit a gram of tnt releases 2673–6702 j joules upon explosion 3 the energy liberated by one gram of tnt was arbitrarily defined as a matter of convention to be 4184 j 4 which is exactly one kilocalorie an explosive s energy is normally expressed as the thermodynamic work produced by its detonation which for tnt has been accurately measured as 4686 j g from a large sample of air blast experiments and theoretically calculated to be 4853 j g 5 the measured pure heat output of a gram of tnt is only 2724 j 6 clarification needed but this is not the important value for explosive blast effect calculations alternative tnt equivalency can be calculated as a function of when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being compared 7 8 9 10 a kiloton of tnt can be visualized as a cube of tnt 8.46 metres 27.8 ft on a side grams tnt symbol tons tnt symbol energy joules energy wh corresponding mass loss gram of tnt g

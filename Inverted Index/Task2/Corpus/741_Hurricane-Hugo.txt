enough timber in south carolina to frame a home for every family in the state of west virginia an immense salvage effort was undertaken to harvest downed pine trees for pulpwood before they deteriorated to the point where they could not be used still standing timber that appeared usable for lumber and plywood frequently had annular separations of the rings that made them dangerous to saw and nearly impossible to cut into plies so they were also downgraded into pulpwood leading to such a drop in pulpwood prices that eventually much of the salvage effort ceased 34 in south carolina which bore the brunt of the storm the federal emergency management agency fema was slow in responding citation needed united states senator from south carolina fritz hollings referred to the agency as a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses during a speech on the floor of the united states senate an investigation was launched which led to some reforms in fema procedures that helped the agency do a somewhat better job during hurricane andrew the next catastrophic hurricane to strike the united states however fema was criticized severely in 2005 for its similarly insufficient response to

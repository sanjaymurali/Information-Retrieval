détroit or fort pontchartrain on-the-strait on the strait known as the detroit river between lakes saint clair and erie cadillac had convinced king louis xiv s chief minister louis phélypeaux comte de pontchartrain that a permanent community there would strengthen french control over the upper great lakes and discourage british aspirations the hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied cadillac built a fort enclosing one arpent 14 15 about 0.85 acres 3,400 m2 the equivalent of just under 200 feet 61 m per side and named it fort pontchartrain cadillac s wife marie thérèse guyon soon moved to detroit becoming one of the first european women to settle in the michigan wilderness the town quickly became a major fur-trading and shipping post the Église de saint-anne church of saint ann was founded the same year while the original building does not survive the congregation continues to be active today cadillac later departed to serve as the french governor of louisiana from 1710 to 1716 french attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the fox wars involving the meskwaki fox and their allies versus the french and their native allies at the same time the french strengthened fort michilimackinac at the straits of mackinac to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire by the mid-18th century the french also occupied forts at present-day niles and sault ste marie though

mid-atlantic states new england and atlantic canada part of the 1991 atlantic hurricane season hurricane bob was one of the costliest hurricanes in new england history the second named storm and first hurricane of the 1991 atlantic hurricane season bob developed from an area of low pressure near the bahamas on august 16 the depression steadily intensified and became tropical storm bob late on august 16 bob curved north-northwestward as a tropical storm but re-curved to the north-northeast after becoming a hurricane on august 17 as such it brushed the outer banks of north carolina on august 18 and august 19 and subsequently intensified into a major hurricane category 3 or greater on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale after peaking in intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph 185 km h bob weakened slightly as it approached the coast of new england bob made landfall twice in rhode island as a category 2 hurricane on august 19 first on block island and then in newport upon doing so it became the only hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous united states during the 1991 season moving further inland bob rapidly weakened and deteriorated to a tropical storm while emerging into the gulf of maine shortly thereafter bob made landfall in maine as a strong tropical storm early on august 20 bob entered the canadian province of new brunswick a few hours later where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by august 21 the remnants of bob crossed newfoundland and re-emerged into the open atlantic ocean the remnants traveled a long distance across the northern atlantic ocean and finally dissipated west of portugal on august 29 bob left extensive damage throughout new england in its wake totaling approximately 1.5 billion 1991 usd 2.64 billion 2017 usd this made it one of the costliest united states hurricanes at the time as of 2013 it ranked thirty-second in the category in addition seventeen fatalities were reported in association with bob the loss of life and most of the damage occurred as a result of high winds and rough seas there were six confirmed tornadoes during its passage bob is the most recent hurricane to hit the new england states directly as a hurricane 1 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale hurricane bob originated from the remnants of a frontal trough to the southeast of bermuda on august 12 the system tracked towards the southwest and later west towards the bahamas by august 15th satellite analysis of the system found a weak low pressure area a couple hundred miles east of the bahamas 2 operationally the system was not declared a tropical depression until 0600 utc on august 16 after a reconnaissance mission into the storm found a closed circulation and flight level winds of 37 mph 60 km h 3 after post-storm analysis it was determined that the low had developed into a depression around 0000 utc several hours after being designated the system began to develop convective banding features roughly 18 hours after being declared a depression the national hurricane center nhc upgraded it to a tropical storm giving it the name bob at this time bob was situated roughly 140 mi 225 km northeast of nassau bahamas the storm tracked slowly towards the northwest in response to the deep layer mean flow it was embedded within 2 a deepening trough over the eastern united states was forecast to turn the storm toward the north on august 16 this turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated 4 the storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced from the center of circulation however upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the gulf stream 5 later that day bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719 utc following this reading the nhc upgraded the storm to a category 1 hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale 2 shortly after the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast in response to a subtropical ridge over the atlantic and the trough over the southeastern united states 6 by august 18 the nhc noted that the hurricane was asymmetrical having uneven distribution of the wind radii 7 later that day deep convection continued to form and an eye later appeared on satellite imagery early the next day the eye became increasingly defined as the center of bob passed roughly 35 mi 55 km from the north carolina coastline by 0600 utc hurricane hunters recorded flight level winds of 140 mph 225 km h corresponding to surface winds of 115 mph 185 km h at this time the barometric pressure of the storm also decreased to 950 mbar hpa 28.05 inhg the lowest pressure recorded during the storm after attaining this intensity the hurricane tracked quickly northeast at 25 mph 35 km h steered by the trough over the southeast united states an upper-level cutoff low over the great lakes region and the subtropical ridge over the atlantic 6 hurricane bob near peak intensity the track of hurricane bob by august 19 was similar to that of hurricane carol in 1954 another major hurricane that impacted new england 6 significantly cooler sea surface temperatures in the path of the hurricane resulted in weakening leading to the eye becoming cloud-filled later on august 19 the western portion of the eyewall brushed the eastern tip of long island around 1800 utc the center of bob made landfall near newport rhode island with winds of 100 mph 155 km h making it a category 2 hurricane the storm quickly weakened as it tracked through rhode island and massachusetts before entering the gulf of maine around 0130 utc on august 20 the now weakened tropical storm bob made another landfall near rockport maine with winds of 70 mph 110 km h 6 later that day bob had crossed through maine and part of new brunswick canada and entered the gulf of st lawrence around 1800 utc the former hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early the next day the storm passed over northern newfoundland before re-entering the atlantic ocean rapidly tracking eastward the storm briefly weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression on august 22 after restrengthening to tropical storm-force winds the remnants of bob turned towards the southeast and slowed once more the extratropical system weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression however it did not re-intensify the storm slowly tracked towards the east before dissipating off the coast of portugal on august 29 6 preparations edit rainfall from hurricane bob in the united states watches and warnings edit several hours after the declaration of tropical storm bob on august 16 the government of the bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the northwestern bahamas between the islands of andros and eleuthera after the storm turned northward this warning was discontinued as tropical storm-force winds were no longer expected to affect the islands shortly before bob was upgraded to a hurricane on august 17 the nhc issued a hurricane watch for coastal areas of north carolina between little river inlet northward to virginia beach virginia roughly four hours after this watch it was upgraded to a hurricane warning a new hurricane watch was issued late on august 17 encompassing areas between virginia beach northward to cape henlopen delaware this watch was also upgraded to a warning on august 18 as bob paralleled the mid-atlantic coastline during the afternoon hours a tropical storm warning was declared for areas in the lower chesapeake bay area including norfolk virginia 8 a new extensive hurricane warning was issued late on august 18 as forecasts showed bob moving directly over southern new england the warning covered areas between cape henlopen delaware to plymouth massachusetts including long island and long island sound early on august 19 all watches and warnings south of cape lookout north carolina were discontinued and the hurricane warning was extended northward to encompass areas south of eastport maine the canadian hurricane centre began issuing warnings for atlantic canada later that day nova scotia prince edward island and new brunswick were placed under wind and heavy rain warnings 8 by the morning of august 20 all watches and warnings in the united states were discontinued however a brief tropical storm warning was declared for coastal maine between rockland and eastport before the remnants of bob moved through eastern canada the advisories for atlantic canada were later discontinued after the system moved out of the region 9 mid-atlantic states and the carolinas edit following the issuance of a hurricane warning in north carolina on august 17 8 mandatory evacuation orders were declared for the outermost islands in the state local police assisted significant traffic as an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people left the region at the height of the evacuations delays in some places exceeded three hours despite the large number of evacuees an additional 50,000 people were estimated to have stayed home and wait out the storm several bridges in the area were shut down prior to bob s arrival as hurricane-force winds were likely to create life-threatening conditions on them the national park service in the state also shut down campgrounds across the outer banks 10 an evacuation shelter was also opened in carteret county 11 in virginia 125 planes were relocated from langley air force base to wright-patterson air force base in dayton ohio roughly 400 people evacuated from coastal areas in maryland and stores in ocean city reported a substantial increase in sales related to storm preparation further north in new jersey casinos prepared sandbags to protect the structures and tape to cover windows 11 in suffolk county new york emergency officials were unsure of whether or not to issue evacuation orders for residents along coastal areas this contemplation led to mixed messages on the ability of the government being sent to the public by the evening of august 19 the evacuation order was not issued however the county was placed under a state of emergency and disaster centers were opened 12 the american red cross opened four shelters on long island that housed 800 people during the storm 13 new england and canada edit prior to bob s arrival in new england officials in connecticut and rhode island declared a state of emergency in anticipation of significant damage all state workers in the area were told to go home early and prepare for the storm the connecticut legislature canceled a session on the state s budget and governor lowell p weicker jr activated the emergency operations center

to avoid possible risks by using helicopter he drove by motorcade to the base during this time portions of interstate 95 were closed to allow him direct access to the air force base however this created many miles of backup as thousands of residents moved inland 17 eight shelters were opened in new hampshire 15 and about 5,200 people – mostly tourists – evacuated the coastline 19 there were 49 shelters opened in neighboring maine 15 and about 8,600 people evacuated along the coastline in york county 20 in the bay of fundy fishermen were urged to return to port in fears of large swells

the hurricane fell at the portland international jetport where 8.24 in 209 mm fell during its passage 53 this contributed to august 1991 being the wettest month on record in portland 54 at the time its 24‑hour rainfall total of 7.83 in 199 mm was the highest on record although it was surpassed in october 1996 by an extratropical system fueled by hurricane lili the rains from bob led to a record

bay of fundy 57 aftermath edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names following the storm s passage the long island lighting company used 165 workers to restore the power outages on long island in connecticut state officials deployed about 200 trucks to remove debris on roads the massachusetts national guard was activated to assist in relief efforts 13 in rhode island a man was killed while repairing damage caused by bob 61 beaches in the state re-opened by five days after the storm 62 the hurricane mixed the waters in long island sound and prevented the algae bloom that happened in previous summers 63 in the days after bob the commonwealth electric company brought electricians from outside the company and put their own workers on 16‑hour shifts to restore power across massachusetts 43 most massachusetts residents excluding those living on cape cod had their power restored within five days 62 the hurricane struck toward the end of the summer which significantly impacted the tourism season already in the midst of a recession 43 the new england coast was affected by a powerful nor easter known as the perfect storm about two months after the hurricane struck the region some locations experienced worse damage from the october storm than from bob 64 due to the high damage from hurricane bob president george h.w bush declared the following states as disaster in order rhode island massachusetts maine connecticut new hampshire and new york 65 damage in maine was insufficient to qualify for individual family assistance 56 instead the declaration allocated federal funding to reimburse cities for debris removal repairing damaged public buildings and other municipal expenses for each of the states despite the declaration the federal government did not immediately provide aid to the affected region this was partially due to president bush considering the storm a disaster but not an emergency which therefore required cuts from other budgets to offset the relief aid this was in opposition to the democratic-controlled congress who requested an expedited process 66 the name bob was subsequently retired by the world meteorological organization s hurricane committee and will never be used again for an atlantic hurricane 67

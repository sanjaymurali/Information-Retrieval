toxin wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia    redirected from toxins jump to navigation search this article is about the class of poisonous substances for other uses see toxin disambiguation a toxin from ancient greek τοξικόν toxikon is a poisonous substance produced within living cells or organisms 1 2 synthetic toxicants created by artificial processes are thus excluded the term was first used by organic chemist ludwig brieger 1849–1919 3 toxins can be small molecules peptides or proteins that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by body tissues interacting with biological macromolecules such as enzymes or cellular receptors toxins vary greatly in their toxicity ranging from usually minor such as a bee sting to almost immediately deadly such as botulinum toxin terminology edit toxins are often distinguished from other chemical agents by their method of production—the word toxin does not specify method of delivery compare with venom and the broader meaning of poison—all substances that can also cause disturbances to organisms it simply means it is a biologically produced poison there was an ongoing terminological dispute between nato and the warsaw pact over whether to call a toxin a biological or chemical agent in which the nato opted for biological agent and the warsaw pact like most other countries in the world for chemical agent citation needed according to an international committee of the red cross review of the biological weapons convention toxins are poisonous products of organisms unlike biological agents they are inanimate and not capable of reproducing themselves and since the signing of the constitition there have been no disputes among the parties regarding the definition of biological agents or toxins 4 according to title 18 of the united states code . the term toxin means the toxic material or product of plants animals microorganisms including but not limited to bacteria viruses fungi rickettsiae or protozoa or infectious substances or a recombinant or synthesized molecule whatever their origin and method of production.. 5 a rather informal terminology of individual toxins relates them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable hemotoxin causes destruction of red blood cells hemolysis phototoxin causes dangerous photosensitivity on a broader scale toxins may be classified as either exotoxins being excreted by an organism or endotoxins that are released mainly when bacteria are lysed biotoxins edit the term biotoxin is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological origin 6 7 biotoxins are further classified into fungal biotoxins or short mycotoxins microbial biotoxins plant biotoxins short phytotoxins and animal biotoxins toxins produced by microorganisms are important virulence determinants responsible for microbial pathogenicity and or evasion of the host immune response 8 biotoxins vary greatly in purpose and mechanism and can be highly complex the venom of the cone snail contains dozens of small proteins each targeting a specific nerve channel or receptor or relatively small protein biotoxins in nature have two primary functions predation in the spider snake scorpion jellyfish wasp defense in the bee ant termite honeybee wasp poison dart frog some of the more well known types of biotoxins include cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacteria dinotoxins produced by dinoflagellates necrotoxins cause necrosis i.e. death in the cells they encounter and destroy all types of tissue citation needed necrotoxins spread through the bloodstream citation needed in humans skin and muscle tissues are most sensitive to necrotoxins citation needed organisms that possess necrotoxins include the brown recluse or fiddle back spider most rattlesnakes and vipers produce phospholipase and various trypsin-like serine proteases puff adder necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh eating bacterium streptococcus pyogenes produces a pore forming toxin neurotoxins primarily affect the nervous systems of animals the group neurotoxins generally consists of ion channel toxins that disrupt ion channel conductance organisms that possess neurotoxins include the black widow spider most scorpions the box jellyfish elapid snakes the cone snail the blue-ringed octopus venomous fish frogs palythoa coral various different types of algae cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates myotoxins are small basic peptides found in snake and lizard venoms they cause muscle tissue damage by a non enzymatic receptor based mechanism organisms that possess myotoxins include rattlesnakes eastern bearded dragon cytotoxins are toxic at the level of individual cells either in a non-specific fashion or only in certain types of living cells ricin from castor beans apitoxin from honey bees t-2 mycotoxin from certain toxic mushrooms environmental toxins edit the term environmental toxin can sometimes explicitly include synthetic contaminants 9 such as industrial pollutants and other artificially made toxic substances as this contradicts most formal definitions of the term toxin it is important to confirm what the researcher means when encountering the term outside of microbiological contexts environmental toxins from food chains that may be dangerous to human health include paralytic shellfish poisoning psp 10 11 12 amnesic shellfish poisoning asp 13 14 diarrheal shellfish poisoning dsp 15 16 neurotoxic shellfish poisoning nsp 17 18 19 finding information about toxins edit the toxicology and environmental health information program tehip 20 at the united states national library of medicine nlm maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related resources produced by tehip and by other government agencies and organizations this web site includes links to databases bibliographies tutorials and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources tehip also is responsible for the toxicology data network toxnet 21 an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web toxmap is a geographic information system gis that is part of toxnet toxmap uses maps of the united states to help users visually explore data from the united states environmental protection agency s epa toxics release inventory and superfund basic research programs computational resources for prediction of toxic peptides and proteins edit one of the bottlenecks in peptide protein-based therapy is their toxicity recently in silico models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins developed by gajendra pal singh raghava s group 22 predict toxicity with reasonably good accuracy the prediction models are based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides the prediction tool is freely accessible to public in the form of web server 23 misuse of the term edit when used non-technically the term toxin is often applied to any toxic substance even though the term toxicant would be more appropriate toxic substances not directly of biological origin are also termed poisons and many non-technical and lifestyle journalists follow this usage to refer to toxic substances in general clarification needed in the context of quackery and alternative medicine the term toxin is used to refer to any substance alleged to cause ill health this could range from trace amounts of potentially dangerous pesticides to supposedly harmful substances produced in the body by intestinal fermentation auto-intoxication to food ingredients such as table sugar monosodium glutamate msg and aspartame 24

forecasting weather portal v t e hail is a form of solid precipitation it is distinct from ice pellets american sleet though the two are often confused 1 it consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice each of which is called a hailstone ice pellets american sleet falls generally in cold weather while hail growth is greatly inhibited during cold surface temperatures 2 unlike other forms of water ice such as graupel which is made of rime and ice pellets which are smaller and translucent hailstones usually measure between 5 millimetres 0.2 in and 15 centimetres 6 in in diameter the metar reporting code for hail 5 mm 0.20 in or greater is gr while smaller hailstones and graupel are coded gs hail is possible within most thunderstorms as it is produced by cumulonimbus 3 and within 2 nautical miles 3.7 km of the parent storm hail formation requires environments of strong upward motion of air with the parent thunderstorm similar to tornadoes and lowered heights of the freezing level in the mid-latitudes hail forms near the interiors of continents while in the tropics it tends to be confined to high elevations there are methods available to detect hail-producing thunderstorms using weather satellites and weather radar imagery hailstones generally fall at higher speeds as they grow in size though complicating factors such as melting friction with air wind and interaction with rain and other hailstones can slow their descent through earth s atmosphere severe weather warnings are issued for hail when the stones reach a damaging size as it can cause serious damage to human-made structures and most commonly farmers crops definition edit any thunderstorm which produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm 4 hail has a diameter of 5 millimetres 0.20 in or more 3 hailstones can grow to 15 centimetres 6 in and weigh more than 0.5 kilograms 1.1 lb 5 unlike ice pellets hailstones are layered and can be irregular and clumped together hail is composed of transparent ice or alternating layers of transparent and translucent ice at least 1 millimetre 0.039 in thick which are deposited upon the hailstone as it travels through the cloud suspended aloft by air with strong upward motion until its weight overcomes the updraft and falls to the ground although the diameter of hail is varied in the united states the average observation of damaging hail is between 2.5 cm 1 in and golf ball-sized 1.75 in 6 stones larger than 2 cm 0.80 in are usually considered large enough to cause damage the meteorological service of canada issues severe thunderstorm warnings when hail that size or above is expected 7 the us national weather service has a 2.5 cm 1 in or greater in diameter threshold effective january 2010 an increase over the previous threshold of ¾-inch hail 8 other countries have different thresholds according local sensitivity to hail for instance grape growing areas could be adversely impacted by smaller hailstones hailstones can be very large or very small depending on how strong the updraft is weaker hailstorms produce smaller hailstones than stronger hailstorms such as supercells formation edit hail forms in strong thunderstorm clouds particularly those with intense updrafts high liquid water content great vertical extent large water droplets and where a good portion of the cloud layer is below freezing 0 °c 32 °f 3 these types of strong updrafts can also indicate the presence of a tornado 9 the growth rate is maximized where air is near a temperature of −13 °c 9 °f citation needed layer nature of the hailstones edit hail shaft severe thunderstorms containing hail can exhibit a characteristic green coloration 10 like other precipitation in cumulonimbus clouds hail begins as water droplets as the droplets rise and the temperature goes below freezing they become supercooled water and will freeze on contact with condensation nuclei a cross-section through a large hailstone shows an onion-like structure this means the hailstone is made of thick and translucent layers alternating with layers that are thin white and opaque former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents falling into a zone of humidity and refreezing as they were uplifted this up and down motion was thought to be responsible for the successive layers of the hailstone new research based on theory as well as field study has shown this is not necessarily true the storm s updraft with upwardly directed wind speeds as high as 110 miles per hour 180 km h 11 blows the forming hailstones up the cloud as the hailstone ascends it passes into areas of the cloud where the concentration of humidity and supercooled water droplets varies the hailstone’s growth rate changes depending on the variation in humidity and supercooled water droplets that it encounters the accretion rate of these water droplets is another factor in the hailstone’s growth when the hailstone moves into an area with a high concentration of water droplets it captures the latter and acquires a translucent layer should the hailstone move into an area where mostly water vapour is available it acquires a layer of opaque white ice 12 furthermore the hailstone’s speed depends on its position in the cloud’s updraft and its mass this determines the varying thicknesses of the layers of the hailstone the accretion rate of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstone depends on the relative velocities between these water droplets and the hailstone itself this means that generally the larger hailstones will form some distance from the stronger updraft where they can pass more time growing 12 as the hailstone grows it releases latent heat which keeps its exterior in a liquid phase because it undergoes wet growth the outer layer is sticky i.e more adhesive so a single hailstone may grow by collision with other smaller hailstones forming a larger entity with an irregular shape 13 the hailstone will keep rising in the thunderstorm until its mass can no longer be supported by the updraft this may take at least 30 minutes based on the force of the updrafts in the hail-producing thunderstorm whose top is usually greater than 10 km high it then falls toward the ground while continuing to grow based on the same processes until it leaves the cloud it will later begin to melt as it passes into air above freezing temperature 14 thus a unique trajectory in the thunderstorm is sufficient to explain the layer-like structure of the hailstone the only case in which multiple trajectories can be discussed is in a multicellular thunderstorm where the hailstone may be ejected from the top of the mother cell and captured in the updraft of a more intense daughter cell this however is an exceptional case 12 factors favoring hail edit hail is most common within continental interiors of the mid-latitudes as hail formation is considerably more likely when the freezing level is below the altitude of 11,000 feet 3,400 m 15 movement of dry air into strong thunderstorms over continents can increase the frequency of hail by promoting evaporational cooling which lowers the freezing level of thunderstorm clouds giving hail a larger volume to grow in accordingly hail is less common in the tropics despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater altitude hail in the tropics occurs mainly at higher elevations 16 hail growth becomes vanishingly small when air temperatures fall below −30 °c −22 °f as supercooled water droplets become rare at these temperatures 15 around thunderstorms hail is most likely within the cloud at elevations above 20,000 feet 6,100 m between 10,000 feet 3,000 m and 20,000 feet 6,100 m 60 percent of hail is still within the thunderstorm though 40 percent now lies within the clear air under the anvil below 10,000 feet 3,000 m hail is equally distributed in and around a thunderstorm to a distance of 2 nautical miles 3.7 km 17 climatology edit hail occurs most frequently within continental interiors at mid-latitudes and is less common in the tropics despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes 18 hail is also much more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards known as orographic lifting thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely 19 the higher elevations also result in there being less time available for hail to melt before reaching the ground one of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern india which reported one of the highest hail-related death tolls on record in 1888 20 china also experiences significant hailstorms 21 central europe and southern australia also experience a lot of hailstorms popular regions for hailstorms are southern and western germany northern and eastern france and southern and eastern benelux in south-eastern europe croatia and serbia experience frequent occurrences of hail 22 in north america hail is most common in the area where colorado nebraska and wyoming meet known as hail alley 23 hail in this region occurs between the months of march and october during the afternoon and evening hours with the bulk of the occurrences from may through september cheyenne wyoming is north america s most hail-prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season 24 to the north of this area and also just downwind of the rocky mountains is the hailstorm alley region of alberta which also experiences an increased incidence of significant hail events short-term detection edit example of a three body spike the weak triangular echoes pointed by the arrow behind the red and white thunderstorm core are related to hail inside the storm weather radar is a very useful tool to detect the presence of hail-producing thunderstorms however radar data has to be complemented by a knowledge of current atmospheric conditions which can allow one to determine if the current atmosphere is conducive to hail development modern radar scans many angles around the site reflectivity values at multiple angles above ground level in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels summing reflectivities in the vertically integrated liquid or vil gives the liquid water content in the cloud research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm is related to the evolution of vil vil divided by the vertical extent of the storm called vil density has a relationship with hail size although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate 25 traditionally hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground certain patterns of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well the three body scatter spike is an example this is the result of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar the energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path forming a cone of weaker reflectivities more recently the polarization properties of weather radar returns have been analyzed to differentiate between hail and heavy rain 26 27 the use of differential reflectivity z d r displaystyle z dr in combination with horizontal reflectivity z h displaystyle z h has led to a variety of hail classification algorithms 28 visible satellite imagery is beginning to be used to detect hail but false alarm rates remain high using this method 29 size and terminal velocity edit hailstones ranging in size from few millimetres to over a centimetre in diameter large hailstone with concentric rings the size of hailstones is best determined by measuring their diameter with a ruler in the absence of a ruler hailstone size is often visually estimated by comparing its size to that of known objects such as coins 30 using the objects such as hen s eggs peas and marbles for comparing hailstone sizes is imprecise due to their varied dimensions the uk organisation torro also scales for both hailstones and hailstorms 31 when observed at an airport metar code is used within a surface weather observation which relates to the size of the hailstone within metar code gr is used to indicate larger hail of a diameter of at least 0.25 inches 6.4 mm gr is derived from the french word grêle smaller-sized hail as well as snow pellets use the coding of gs which is short for the french word grésil 32 the largest recorded hailstone in the united states by diameter 7.9 inches 20 cm and weight 1.94 pounds 0.88 kg the hailstone fell in vivian south dakota on july 23 2010 hail records edit megacryometeors large rocks of ice that are not associated with thunderstorms are not officially recognized by the world meteorological organization as hail which are aggregations of ice associated with thunderstorms and therefore records of extreme characteristics of megacryometeors are not given as hail records heaviest 1.02 kg 2.25 lb gopalganj district bangladesh 14 april 1986 33 34 largest diameter officially measured 7.9 inches 20 cm diameter 18.622 inches 47.3 cm circumference vivian south dakota 23 july 2010 35 largest circumference officially measured 18.74 inches 47.6 cm circumference 7.0 inches 17.8 cm diameter aurora nebraska 22 june 2003 34 36 kericho hills in kenya experiences hailstorms on average around 132 days annually kericho hills is one of the main tea-producing regions in the world and it is likely that dust particles created by the activities of tea-pickers act as nucleation points in the atmosphere around which hailstorms form 37 terminal velocity of hail or the speed at which hail is falling when it strikes the ground varies it is estimated that a hailstone of 1 centimetre 0.39 in in diameter falls at a rate of 9 metres per second 20 mph while stones the size of 8 centimetres 3.1 in in diameter fall at a rate of 48 metres per second 110 mph hailstone velocity is dependent on the size of the stone friction with air it is falling through the motion of wind it is falling through collisions with raindrops or other hailstones and melting as the stones fall through a warmer atmosphere as hail stones are not perfect spheres it is difficult to calculate their speed accurately 38 hazards edit main article list of costly or deadly hailstorms hail can cause serious damage notably to automobiles aircraft skylights glass-roofed structures livestock and most commonly farmers crops 24 hail damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen such as leaks or cracks it is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs but all roofs have their own hail damage detection problems 39 metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged coatings 40 hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft 41 when hailstones exceed 0.5 inches 13 mm in diameter planes can be seriously damaged within seconds 42 the hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering windshields and windows wheat corn soybeans and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage 20 hail is one of canada s most expensive hazards 43 rarely massive hailstones have been known to cause concussions or fatal head trauma hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history one of the earliest known incidents occurred around the 9th century in roopkund uttarakhand india where 200 to 600 nomads seem to have died of injuries from hail the size of cricket balls 44 the largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the united states fell on july 23 2010 in vivian south dakota it measured 8 inches 20 cm in diameter and 18.62 inches 47.3 cm in circumference weighing in at 1.93 pounds 0.88 kg 45 this broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone 7 inches diameter and 18.74 inches circumference still the greatest circumference hailstone which fell in aurora nebraska in the united states on june 22 2003 as well as the record for weight set by a hailstone of 1.67 pounds 0.76 kg that fell in coffeyville kansas in 1970 45 accumulations edit accumulated hail after a storm in charlton massachusetts narrow zones where hail accumulates on the ground in association with thunderstorm activity are known as hail streaks or hail swaths 46 which can be detectable by satellite after the storms pass by 47 hailstorms normally last from a few minutes up to 15 minutes in duration 24 accumulating hail storms can blanket the ground with over 2 inches 5.1 cm of hail cause thousands to lose power and bring down many trees flash flooding and mudslides within areas of steep terrain can be a concern with accumulating hail 48 depths of up to 18 in 0.46 m have been reported a landscape covered in accumulated hail generally resembles one covered in accumulated snow and any significant accumulation of hail has the same restrictive effects as snow accumulation albeit over a smaller area on transport and infrastructure 49 accumulated hail can also cause flooding by blocking drains and hail can be carried in the floodwater turning into a snow-like slush which is deposited at lower elevations on somewhat rare occasions a thunderstorm can become stationary or nearly so while prolifically producing hail and significant depths of accumulation do occur this tends to happen in mountainous areas such as the july 29 2010 case 50 of a foot of hail accumulation in boulder county colorado on june 5 2015 hail up to four feet deep fell on one city block in denver colorado the hailstones described as between the size of bumble bees and ping pong balls were accompanied by rain and high winds the hail fell in only the one area leaving the surrounding area untouched it fell for one and a half hours between 10 p.m and 11 30 p.m a meteorologist for the national weather service in boulder said it s a very interesting phenomenon we saw the storm stall it produced copious amounts of hail in one small area it s a meteorological thing tractors used to clear the area filled more than 30 dump-truck loads of hail 51 research focused on four individual days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches 15 cm of hail in 30 minutes on the colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather radar and lightning characteristics 52 suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence a fundamental problem in continuing research in this area is that unlike hail diameter hail depth is not commonly reported the lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods a cooperative effort between the university of colorado and the national weather service is in progress the joint project s goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths 53 suppression and prevention edit hail cannon in an old castle in banska stiavnica slovakia during the middle ages people in europe used to ring church bells and fire cannons to try to prevent hail and the subsequent damage to crops updated versions of this approach are available as modern hail cannons cloud seeding after world war ii was done to eliminate the hail threat 11 particularly across the soviet union – where it was claimed a 70 to 98 percent reduction in crop damage from hail storms was achieved by deploying silver iodide in clouds using rockets and artillery shells 54 55 hail suppression programs have been undertaken by 15 countries between 1965 and 2005 11 20

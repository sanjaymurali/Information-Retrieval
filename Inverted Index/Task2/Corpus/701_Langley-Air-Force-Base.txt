create a safety buffer zone around the base 5 history edit langley field was named after samuel pierpont langley an aerodynamic pioneer and a former secretary of the smithsonian institution langley began aerodynamic experiments in 1887 and formed a basis for practical pioneer aviation he built and saw the first steam model airplane in 1896 and the first gasoline model in 1903 both planes were believed to be capable of flight he also built the first man-carrying gasoline airplane in 1903 which failed to fly on its first attempt and broke apart and crashed on its second it was after major modification eleven years later flown successfully by glenn curtiss for a little over 3 seconds traveling 150 feet through the air in 1914 6 langley field was the first air service base built especially for air power is the oldest continually active air force base in the world and is the oldest airfield in virginia origins edit in 1916 the national advisory council for aeronautics naca predecessor to nasa established the need for a joint airfield and proving ground for army navy and naca aircraft naca determined that the site must be near water for over-water flying be flat and relatively clear for expansion and the landing and take-off of aircraft and near an army post the army appointed a board of officers who searched for a location the officers sometimes posed as hunters and fishermen to avoid potential land speculation which would arise if the government s interest in purchasing land was revealed fifteen locations were scouted before a site near hampton in elizabeth city county was selected 7 langley field in 1920 in 1917 the new proving ground was designated langley field for one of america s early air pioneers samuel pierpont langley langley had first made tests with his manned heavier-than-air craft launched from a houseboat catapult in 1903 his first attempts failed and he died in 1906 shortly before a rebuilt version of his craft soared into the sky

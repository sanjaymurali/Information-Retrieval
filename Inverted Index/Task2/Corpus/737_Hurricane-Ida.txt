peninsula cuba and southeastern united states part of the 2009 atlantic hurricane season hurricane ida was the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone during the 2009 atlantic hurricane season crossing the coastline of nicaragua with winds of 80 mph 130 km h the remnants of the storm became a powerful nor easter that caused widespread damage along coastal areas of the mid-atlantic states ida formed on november 4 in the southwestern caribbean and within 24 hours struck the nicaragua coast with winds of 80 mph 130 km h it weakened significantly over land although it restrengthened in the yucatán channel to peak winds of 105 mph 165 km h hurricane ida weakened and became an extratropical cyclone in the northern gulf of mexico before spreading across the southeastern united states the remnants of ida contributed to the formation of a nor easter that significantly affected the eastern coast of the united states numerous watches and warnings were issued during the hurricane s existence areas from panama to maine were affected by either the storm or the nor easter low in nicaragua nearly 3,000 people evacuated coastal areas ahead of the storm more extensive evacuations in mexico relocated over 100,000 residents and tourists in the united states several counties in louisiana alabama and florida declared a state of emergency because of fear of significant damage from the storm officials issued voluntary evacuations and most schools and non-emergency offices in the region closed in central america ida brought heavy rainfall to parts of costa rica nicaragua and honduras several people were reported missing in nicaragua however post-storm reports denied these claims thousands of buildings collapsed or sustained damage and roughly 40,000 people were left homeless damages from ida in nicaragua amounted to at least 46 million córdoba 2.12 million us aside from heavy rainfall in mexico and cuba little impact from ida was reported in either country in the united states the remnants caused substantial damage mainly in the mid-atlantic states one person was killed by ida after drowning in rough seas while six others lost their lives in various incidents related to the nor easter widespread heavy rainfall led to numerous reports of flash flooding in areas from mississippi to maine overall the two systems caused nearly 300 million in damage throughout the country meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale hurricane ida originated from a weak tropical wave that reached the western caribbean on november 1 2009 by november 2 the system spawned an area of low pressure north of panama which moved very little over the following days the low became increasingly organized within a favorable environment that allowed deep convection to develop by november 4 the low had become sufficiently organized for the national hurricane center nhc to classify it as tropical depression eleven at this time the depression was situated just southwest of san andrés island 1 convective banding features became increasingly defined throughout the day 2 and six hours after becoming a depression the system intensified into tropical storm ida 1 light wind shear allowed ida to quickly intensify as it slowly tracked towards the nicaraguan coastline 1 late on november 4 microwave satellite imagery depicted an eye-like featured forming within the storm the storm tracked west-northwestward in response to a weak ridge over the north-central caribbean sea and a weak trough over the southwestern gulf of mexico these features were also responsible for ida s slow forward motion 3 early on november 5 the storm intensified into a category 1 hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale as it passed near the corn islands at approximately 1117 utc the center of ida made landfall near rio grande nicaragua with winds of 80 mph 130 km h 4 after the hurricane moved inland the high mountains of nicaragua caused the convection associated with the hurricane to diminish resulting in rapid weakening roughly 18 hours after landfall ida weakened to a tropical depression as it turned northward over honduras 1 late on november 6 ida re-emerged over water entering the northwestern caribbean sea upon moving back over water the storm quickly began to redevelop with convection increasing around the center of circulation 5 early on november 7 ida restrengthened into a tropical storm as it tracked just west of due north 1 very warm sea surface temperatures ahead of the system would have allowed for substantial intensification however wind shear over the area quickly increased resulting in modest strengthening 6 later that day the storm turned northwestward in response to a strong trough over mexico and a mid-level ridge extending from the southeast united states to hispaniola 7 as ida neared the yucatán channel an eye redeveloped and the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane by the morning of november 8 the storm had attained category 2 status with winds of 100 mph 155 km h 1 hurricane ida shortly after attaining its secondary peak intensity on november 9 near the united states gulf coast late on november 8 ida attained its peak intensity with winds of 105 mph 165 km h and a barometric pressure of 975 mbar hpa 28.79 inhg shortly thereafter increasing wind shear and forward speed caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a tropical storm 1 only a small area of convection remained near the center by the morning of november 9 8 despite the strong shear the storm quickly re-organized attaining hurricane status for a third time during the afternoon based on readings from a nearby oil platform and reconnaissance data it was determined that ida attained its secondary peak intensity near the southeast coast of louisiana with winds of 85 mph 140 km h however this intensification was short-lived as a combination of increasing wind shear and decreasing sea-surface temperatures induced weakening to a tropical storm within three hours 1 by the morning of november 10 all of ida s convection appeared displaced to the northeast and the forward motion of the storm slowed substantially additionally the storm had begun to undergo an extratropical transition near the united states gulf coast 9 shortly before making landfall near dauphin island alabama 10 the storm completed its extratropical transition ida crossed mobile bay shortly thereafter and maximum winds decreased below gale-force after slowly tracking eastward for several hours the surface circulation of ida dissipated over the florida panhandle however energy from the storm led to the formation of a new low off the coast of north carolina this new low quickly intensified and became a powerful nor easter that caused substantial damage throughout the mid-atlantic states 1 by november 12 the system attained a minimum pressure of 992 mbar hpa 29.29 inhg along with winds of 65 mph 100 km h 11 the extratropical low weakened the following day and moved out to sea after stalling along the north carolina coastline the remnants of the cyclone persisted through november 17 by which time it had moved over atlantic canada 12 preparations edit central america edit play media satellite animation of hurricane ida moving from the northern caribbean sea into the gulf of mexico shortly after being designated as tropical storm ida on november 4 the government of nicaragua issued a tropical storm warning for the entire coastline of nicaragua and the government of columbia also issued a warning for the nearby islands of san andrés and providencia later that day a hurricane watch was declared for areas between bluefields and the nicaragua–honduras border as ida moved closer to land the tropical storm warning for san andrés and providencia was discontinued several hours later the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were modified to cover areas south of the nicaragua–honduras border to puerto cabezas and a hurricane warning was issued for areas south of puerto cabezas to bluefields after ida made landfall in nicaragua all hurricane advisories were discontinued and replaced by a tropical storm warning shortly thereafter a tropical storm watch was declared for areas along the honduran coastline between limón and the nicaragua–honduras border however all watches and

rainfall in excess of 20 in 510 mm was expected to fall about 1,100 of the evacuees were from corn island 13 and little corn island where their homes were not expected to hold up to hurricane-force winds in bluefields roughly 1,100 people were evacuated to shelters 14 authorities began stockpiling supplies such as food blankets and water that could supply 20,000 people after the storm 15 upon

pre-columbian era a reconstructed taíno village at the tibes ceremonial center the ancient history of the archipelago which is now puerto rico is not well known unlike other indigenous cultures in the new world aztec maya and inca which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies scant artifacts and evidence remain of the puerto rico s indigenous population scarce archaeological findings and early spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them the first comprehensive book on the history of puerto rico was written by fray Íñigo abbad y lasierra in 1786 nearly three centuries after the first spaniards landed on the island 38 the first known settlers were the ortoiroid people an archaic period culture of amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the south american mainland some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years 39 an archeological dig in 1990 on the island of vieques found the remains of a man designated as the puerto ferro man which was dated to around 2000 bc 40 the ortoiroid were displaced by the saladoid a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 bc 39 the igneri tribe migrated to puerto rico between 120 and 400 ad from the region of the orinoco river in northern south america the arcaico and igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries between the 7th and 11th centuries the taíno culture developed on the island by approximately 1000 ad it had become dominant at the time of columbus arrival an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 taíno amerindians led by the cacique chief agüeybaná inhabited the island they called it boriken meaning the great land of the valiant and noble lord 41 the natives lived in small villages each led by a cacique they subsisted by hunting and fishing done generally by men as well as by the women s gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit this lasted until columbus arrived in 1493 42 43 spanish colony 1493–1898 further information captaincy general of puerto rico juan ponce de león santervás de campos valladolid spain puerto rico s first governor conquest and early settlement when columbus arrived in puerto rico during his second voyage on november 19 1493 the island was inhabited by the taíno they called it borikén borinquen in spanish transliteration columbus named the island san juan bautista in honor of st john the baptist e having reported the findings of his first travel columbus brought with him this time a letter from king ferdinand 44 empowered by a papal bull that authorized any course of action necessary for the expansion of the spanish empire and the christian faith juan ponce de león a lieutenant under columbus founded the first spanish settlement caparra on august 8 1508 he later served as the first governor of the island f eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as puerto rico and san juan became the name of the main trading shipping port at the beginning of the 16th century the spanish people began to colonize the island despite the laws of burgos of 1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population some taíno indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization the population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics of european infectious diseases g h i j k colonization the habsburgs in 1520 king charles i of spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining taíno population by that time the taíno people were few in number 52 enslaved africans had already begun to compensate for the native labor loss but their numbers were proportionate to the diminished commercial interest spain soon began to demonstrate for the island colony other nearby islands like cuba saint-domingue and guadeloupe attracted more of the slave trade than puerto rico probably because of greater agricultural interests in those islands on which colonists had developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the atlantic slave trade 53 from the beginning of the country the colonial administration relied heavily on the industry of enslaved africans and creole blacks for public works and defenses primarily in coastal ports and cities where the tiny colonial population had hunkered down with no significant industries or large-scale agricultural production as yet enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements particularly around san juan also forming lasting afro-creole communities meanwhile in the island s interior there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy this mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and in relative isolation set the pattern for what later would be known as the puerto rican jíbaro culture by the end of the 16th century the spanish empire was diminishing and in the face of increasing raids from european competitors the colonial administration throughout the americas fell into a bunker mentality imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the king s silver-laden atlantic fleet to the iberian peninsula san juan served as an important port-of-call for ships driven across the atlantic by its powerful trade winds west indies convoys linked spain to the island sailing between cádiz and the spanish west indies the colony s seat of government was on the forested islet of san juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the spanish caribbean earning the name of the walled city the islet is still dotted with the various forts and walls such as la fortaleza castillo san felipe del morro and castillo san cristóbal designed to protect the population and the strategic port of san juan from the raids of the spanish european competitors hendricksz 1625 attack on san juan puerto rico in 1625 in the battle of san juan the dutch commander boudewijn hendricksz tested the defenses limits like no one else before learning from francis drake s previous failures here he circumvented the cannons of the castle of san felipe del morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the san juan bay he then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the morro s moat and high battlements historians consider this event the worst attack on san juan though the dutch set the village on fire they failed to conquer the morro and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until hendricksz deemed the cause lost hendricksz s expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy constructions of defenses for the san cristóbal hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the morro s artillery urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in spanish hands late colonial period hacienda la fortuna a sugar mill complex in puerto rico painted by francisco oller in 1885 brooklyn museum during the late 16th and early 17th centuries spain concentrated its colonial efforts on the more prosperous mainland north central and south american colonies with the advent of the lively bourbon dynasty in spain in the 1700s the island of puerto rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention more roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities and coastal settlements like arecibo mayaguez and ponce began acquiring importance of their own separate from san juan by the end of the 18th century merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the mercantilist system which turned each colony solely toward the european metropole and limited contact with other nations u.s ships came to surpass spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the island s natural resources slavers which had made but few stops on the island before began selling more enslaved africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations the increasing number of atlantic wars in which the caribbean islands played major roles like the war of jenkins ear the seven years war and the atlantic revolutions ensured puerto rico s growing esteem in madrid s eyes on april 17 1797 sir ralph abercromby fleet invaded the island with a force of 6,000–13,000 men 54 which included german soldiers and royal marines and 60 to 64 ships fierce fighting continued for the next days with spanish troops both sides suffered heavy losses on sunday april 30 the british ceased their attack and began their retreat from san juan by the time independence movements in the larger spanish colonies gained success new waves of loyal creole immigrants began to arrive in puerto rico helping to tilt the island s political balance toward the crown the 16th-century fort castillo san felipe del morro in san juan puerto rico in 1809 to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the european peninsular war the supreme central junta based in cádiz recognized puerto rico as an overseas province of spain this gave the island residents the right to elect representatives to the recently convened spanish parliament cádiz

parliamentary representative from the island of puerto rico died after serving a three-year term in the cortes these parliamentary and constitutional reforms were in force from 1810 to 1814 and again

ethnic european population and economy and expanded the spanish cultural and social imprint on the local character of the island citation needed minor slave revolts had occurred on the island throughout the years with the revolt planned and organized by marcos xiorro in 1821 being the most important even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful xiorro achieved legendary status and is part of puerto rico s folklore 55 politics of liberalism the flag flown by fidel vélez and his men during the intentona de yauco revolt in the early 19th century puerto rico spawned an independence movement that due to harsh persecution by the spanish authorities convened in the island of st thomas the movement was largely inspired by the ideals of simón bolívar in establishing a united provinces of new granada and venezuela that included puerto rico and cuba among the influential members of this movement were brigadier general antonio valero de bernabé and maría de las mercedes barbudo the movement was discovered and governor miguel de la torre had its members imprisoned or exiled 56 with the increasingly rapid growth of independent former spanish colonies in the south and central american states in the first part of the 19th century the spanish crown considered puerto rico and cuba of strategic importance to increase its hold on its last two new world colonies the spanish crown revived the royal decree of graces of 1815 as a result of which 450,000 immigrants mainly spaniards settled on the island in the period up until the american conquest printed in three languages—spanish english and french—it was intended to also attract non-spanish europeans with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the crown hundreds of non spanish families mainly from corsica france germany ireland italy and scotland also immigrated to the island 57 free land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the spanish crown and allegiance to the roman catholic church 57 the offer was very successful and european immigration continued even after 1898 puerto rico still receives spanish and european immigration the lares revolutionary flag poverty and political estrangement with spain led to a small but significant uprising in 1868 known as grito de lares it began in the rural town of lares but was subdued when rebels moved to the neighboring town of san sebastián leaders of this independence movement included ramón emeterio betances considered the father of the puerto rican independence movement and other political figures such as segundo ruiz belvis slavery was abolished in puerto rico in 1873 with provisions for periods of

continued their quest for puerto rican independence in 1897 antonio mattei lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement in yauco organized another uprising which became known as the intentona de yauco they raised what they called the puerto rican flag which was adopted as the national flag the local conservative political factions opposed independence rumors of the planned event spread to the local spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to spanish colonial rule 59 in 1897 luis muñoz rivera and others persuaded the liberal spanish government to agree to grant limited self-government to the island by royal decree in the autonomic charter including a bicameral legislature 60 in 1898 puerto rico s first but short-lived quasi-autonomous government was organized as an overseas province of spain this bilaterally agreed-upon charter maintained a governor appointed by the king of spain – who held the power to annul any legislative decision – and a partially elected parliamentary structure in february governor-general manuel macías inaugurated the new government under the autonomic charter

a member of the navy war board and leading u.s strategic thinker published a book titled the influence of sea power upon history in which he argued for the establishment of a large and powerful navy modeled after the british royal navy part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the caribbean which would serve as coaling and naval stations they would serve as strategic points of defense with the construction of a canal through the isthmus of panama to allow easier passage of ships between the atlantic and pacific oceans 64 the first company of puerto ricans enlisted in the u.s army 1899 william h seward the former secretary of state under presidents abraham lincoln and andrew johnson had also stressed the importance of building a canal in honduras nicaragua or panama he

dollars for puerto rico and cuba 64 since 1894 the united states naval war college had been developing contingency plans for a war with spain by 1896 the u.s office of naval intelligence had prepared a plan that included military operations in puerto rican waters except for one 1895 plan which recommended annexation of the island then named isle of pines later renamed as isla de la juventud a recommendation dropped in later planning plans developed for attacks on spanish territories were intended as support operations against spain s forces in and around cuba 65 recent research suggests

elections higher social security and medicare benefits and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy the latter is currently prohibited 103 statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection according to the government development bank this might be the only solution to the debt crisis congress has the power to vote to allow chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood but in late 2015 there was very little support in the house for this concept other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and medicaid funding the right to vote in presidential elections and the higher federal minimum wage 104 subsequent to the 2017 referendum puerto

the difference between the incumbent party the ppd and its opponent the pnp was a mere 0.6 in the last election this difference is common as the political landscape experiences political cycles between both parties with the ppd ruling all branches of government for 36 of the past 64 years the pnp on the other hand has ruled both the executive and legislative branch concurrently for 16 years the other 12 years experienced a divided government since 1952 puerto rico has had three main political parties the popular democratic party ppd in spanish the new progressive party pnp in spanish and the puerto rican independence party pip the three parties stand for different political status the ppd for example seeks to maintain the island s status with the u.s as a commonwealth while the pnp on the other hand seeks to make puerto rico a state of the united states the pip in contrast seeks a complete separation from the united states by seeking to make puerto rico a sovereign nation in terms

and the partido del pueblo trabajador ppt english working people s party but none obtained more than 1 of the vote other non-registered parties include the puerto rican nationalist party the socialist workers movement and the hostosian national independence movement law main articles constitution of puerto rico and law of puerto rico the insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems puerto rico is the only current u.s possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than american english namely spanish because the u.s federal government operates primarily in english all puerto rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in english in u.s federal courts and litigate federal preemption issues in puerto rican courts title 48 of the united states code outlines the role of the united states code to united states territories and insular areas such as puerto rico after the u.s government assumed control of puerto rico in 1901 it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law criminal procedure and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in california although puerto rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the california penal code the judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the puerto rico supreme court which is the only appellate court required by the constitution all other courts are created by the legislative assembly of puerto rico there is also a federal district court for puerto rico someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a commonwealth court unlike a state court since puerto rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from congress as a state does 149 such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy law and government crime the overall rate of crime is low in puerto rico the territory has a high firearm homicide rate the homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any u.s state in 2014 150 151 most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80 of homicides in puerto rico being drug related 152 political status main articles political status of puerto rico and proposed political status for puerto rico the nature of puerto rico s political relationship with the u.s is the subject of ongoing debate in puerto rico the united states congress and the united nations 153 specifically the basic question is whether puerto rico should remain a u.s territory become a u.s state or become an independent country 154 estado libre asociado in 1950 the u.s congress granted puerto ricans the right to organize a constitutional convention via a referendum that gave them the option of voting their preference yes or no on a proposed u.s law that would organize puerto rico as a commonwealth that would continue united states sovereignty over puerto rico and its people puerto rico s electorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution the constitution of puerto rico was formally adopted on july 3 1952 the constitutional convention specified the name by which the body politic would be known on february 4 1952 the convention approved resolution 22 which chose in english the word commonwealth meaning a politically organized community or state which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system puerto rico officially designates itself with the term commonwealth of puerto rico in its constitution as a translation into english of the term to estado libre asociado ela in 1967 puerto rico s legislative assembly polled the political preferences of the puerto rican electorate by passing a plebiscite act that provided for a vote on the status of puerto rico this constituted the first plebiscite by the legislature for a choice among three status options commonwealth statehood and independence in subsequent plebiscites organized by puerto rico held in 1993 and 1998 without any formal commitment on the part of the u.s government to honor the results the current political status failed to receive majority support in 1993 commonwealth status won by a plurality of votes 48.6 versus 46.3 for statehood while the none of the above option which was the popular democratic party-sponsored choice won in 1998 with 50.3 of the votes versus 46.5 for statehood disputes arose as to the definition of each of the ballot alternatives and commonwealth advocates among others reportedly urged a vote for none of the above 155 156 157 the latest referendum on statehood independence or an associated republic was held on november 6 2012 the people of puerto rico made history by requesting for the first time ever the conclusion of the island s current territorial status almost 78 of registered voters participated in a plebiscite held to resolve puerto rico s status and a clear majority 54 disagreed with puerto rico maintaining its present territorial status furthermore among the possible alternatives sixty-one percent 61 of voters chose the statehood option while one third of the ballots were submitted blank 158 159 on december 11 2012 the legislative assembly of puerto rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the president and the congress of the united states to respond to the referendum of the people of puerto rico held on november 6 2012 to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit puerto rico as a state 100 the initiative has not made puerto rico into a state within the united states the capitol of puerto rico home of the legislative assembly in puerto rico constitutionally puerto rico is subject to the plenary powers of the united states congress under the territorial clause of article iv of the u.s constitution 160 laws enacted at the federal level in the united states apply to puerto rico as well regardless of its political status their residents do not have voting representation in the u.s congress like the different states of the united states puerto rico lacks the full sovereignty of an independent nation for example the power to manage its external relations with other nations which is held by the u.s federal government the supreme court of the united states has indicated that once the u.s constitution has been extended to an area by congress or the courts its coverage is irrevocable to hold that the political branches may switch the constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they not this court say what the law is 161 puerto ricans were collectively made u.s citizens in 1917 as a result of the jones-shafroth act 162 u.s citizens residing in puerto rico cannot vote for the u.s president though both major parties republican and democratic run primary elections in puerto rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate since puerto rico is an unincorporated territory see above and not a u.s state the united states constitution does not fully enfranchise us citizens residing in puerto rico 142 163 see also voting rights in puerto rico only fundamental rights under the american federal constitution and adjudications are applied to puerto ricans various other u.s supreme court decisions have held which rights apply in puerto rico and which ones do not puerto ricans have a long history of service in the u.s armed forces and since 1917 they have been included in the u.s compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effect though the commonwealth government has its own tax laws puerto ricans are also required to pay many kinds of u.s federal taxes not including the federal personal income tax for puerto rico-sourced income but only under certain circumstances 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 in 2009 puerto rico paid 3.742 billion into the us treasury 172 residents of puerto rico pay into social security and are thus eligible for social security benefits upon retirement they are excluded from the supplemental security income ssi and the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the medicaid funding it would receive if it were a u.s state 173 also medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in puerto rico even though the latter paid fully into the system 174 while a state may try an individual for the same crime he she was tried in federal court this is not the case in puerto rico being a us territory puerto rico s authority to enact a criminal code derives from congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states thus such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible 149 in 1992 president george h w bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the commonwealth of puerto rico this memorandum directs all federal departments agencies and officials to treat puerto rico administratively as if it were a state insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in puerto rico just as in any state including the federal bureau of investigation federal emergency management agency transportation security administration social security administration and others while puerto rico has its own commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a u.s state there is also a u.s federal district court in puerto rico and puerto ricans have served as judges in that court and in other federal courts on the u.s mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment sonia sotomayor a new yorker of puerto rican descent serves as an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states puerto ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions including serving as united states ambassadors to other nations international status on november 27 1953 shortly after the establishment of the commonwealth the general assembly of the united nations approved resolution 748 removing puerto rico s classification as a non-self-governing territory the general assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non-self-governing status of puerto rico 175 176 according to the white house task force on puerto rico s political status in its december 21 2007 report the u.s. in its written submission to the un in 1953 never represented that congress could not change its relationship with puerto rico without the territory s consent 177 it stated that the u.s justice department in 1959 reiterated that congress held power over puerto rico pursuant to the territorial clause 178 of the u.s constitution 177 in 1993 the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit stated that congress may unilaterally repeal the puerto rican constitution or the puerto rican federal relations act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice 179 in a 1996 report on a puerto rico status political bill the u.s house committee on resources stated puerto rico s current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government under resolution 1541 the three established forms of full self-government being stated in the report as 1 national independence 2 free association based on separate sovereignty or 3 full integration with another nation on the basis of equality the report concluded that puerto rico . remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of free association with the united states as that status is defined under united states law or international practice that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the u.s congress and that u.s congress can also withdraw the u.s citizenship of puerto rican residents of puerto rico at any time for a legitimate federal purpose 180 181 the application of the u.s constitution to puerto rico is limited by the insular cases in 2006 182 2007 183 2009 184 2010 185 and 2011 186 the united nations special committee on decolonization passed resolutions calling on the united states to expedite a

decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the government of the united states to expedite a process that would allow the puerto rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence 189 on april 29 2010 the u.s house voted 223–169 to approve a measure for a federally sanctioned process for puerto rico s self-determination allowing puerto rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of commonwealth or to have a different political status if puerto ricans voted to continue as a commonwealth the government of puerto rico was authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified if puerto ricans voted to have a different political status a second referendum would determine whether puerto rico would become a u.s state an independent country or a sovereign nation associated with the u.s that would not be subject to the territorial clause of the united states constitution 190 during the house debate a fourth option to retain its present form of commonwealth sometimes referred to as the status quo political status was added as an option in the second plebiscite 190 191 immediately following u.s house passage h.r 2499 was sent to the u.s senate where it was given two formal readings and referred to the senate committee on energy and natural resources on december 22 2010 the 111th united states congress adjourned without any senate vote on h.r.2499 killing the bill 192 the latest task force

united states either via statehood or commonwealth or wish to be independent via independence or free association if continuing to be part of the united states were chosen in the first plebiscite a second vote would be taken between statehood and commonwealth 193 on june 14 2011 president barack obama promised to support a clear decision by the people of puerto rico on statehood 194 that same month the united nations special committee on decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by cuba s delegate on june 20 2011 calling on the united states to expedite a

congress action on november 6 2012 plebiscite results 199 but on april 10 2013 with the issue still being widely debated the white house announced that it will seek 2.5 million to hold another referendum this next one being the first puerto rican status referendum to be financed by the u.s federal government 200 in december 2015 the u.s government submitted a brief as amicus curiae to the u.s supreme court related to the case commonwealth of puerto rico v sanchez valle the u.s government official position is that the u.s constitution does not contemplate sovereign territories that the court has consistently recognized that there is no sovereignty in a territory of the united states but that of the united states itself and a u.s territory has no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state that is because the government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the united states congress s plenary authority over federal territories includes the authority to permit self-government whereby local officials administer a territory s internal affairs 201 on june 9 2016 in commonwealth of puerto rico vs sanchez valle an 6–2 majority of the supreme court of the united states determined that puerto rico is a territory and lacks sovereignty 202 on june 30 2016 the president of the united states of america signed a new law approved by u.s congress h.r 5278 promesa establishing a control board over the puerto rico government this board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations in particular the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government s constitutional power to make all needful rules and regulations regarding u.s territories the president would appoint all seven voting members of the board and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by puerto rico s legislature governor and other public authorities 203 foreign and intergovernmental relations main article foreign and intergovernmental relations of puerto rico puerto rico is subject to the commerce and territorial clause of the constitution of the united states

offices in many foreign countries all spanish-speaking and within the united states itself which now include spain the dominican republic panama colombia washington d.c. new york city and florida and has included in the past offices in chile costa rica and mexico such agreements require permission from the u.s department of state most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the united states and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by puerto rico and different u.s states at the local level puerto rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the department of state of puerto rico an executive department headed by the secretary of state of puerto rico who also serves as

atlantic command lantcom after 1993 usacom which had authority over all us military operations that took place throughout the atlantic puerto rico had been seen as crucial in supporting lantcom s

private entities in puerto rico – such as retired military who rely on ft buchanan for the services available there puerto ricans have participated in many of the military conflicts in which the united states has been involved for example they participated in the american revolution when volunteers from puerto rico cuba and mexico fought the british in 1779 under the command of general bernardo de gálvez 1746–1786 209 and have continued to participate up to the present-day conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 210 a significant number of puerto ricans participate as members and work for

articles economy of puerto rico and puerto rico government-debt crisis puerto rico s gross domestic product gdp by economic sector the economy of puerto rico is classified as a high income economy by the world bank and as the most competitive economy in latin america by the world economic forum but puerto rico currently has a public debt of 72.204 billion equivalent to 103 of gnp and a government deficit of 2.5 billion 212 213 according to world bank gross national income per capita of puerto rico in 2013 is 23,830 ppp international dollars ranked as 63rd among all sovereign and dependent territories entities in the world 214 its economy is mainly driven by manufacturing primarily pharmaceuticals textiles petrochemicals and electronics followed by the service industry primarily finance insurance real estate and tourism n o in recent years the territory has also become a popular destination for mice meetings incentives conferencing exhibitions with a modern convention centre district overlooking the port of san juan 216 the geography of puerto rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity primarily due to its relatively small size as an island its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materials citation needed and consequently its dependence on imports as well as its territorial status with the united states which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions particularly in its shipping industry puerto rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011 interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth and entered into recession again in 2013 following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the irs section 936 corporate incentives that the u.s internal revenue code had applied to puerto rico this irs section was critical to the economy as it established tax exemptions for u.s corporations that settled in puerto rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time without paying federal tax on corporate income puerto rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80 of the rest of the world 217 academically most of puerto rico s economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired have been repealed or no longer apply to puerto rico its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history p its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party

gdp per capita in the region its main trading partners are the united states itself ireland and japan with most products coming from east asia mainly from china hong kong and taiwan at a global scale puerto rico s dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials makes puerto rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate puerto rico s agricultural sector represents less than 1 of gnp 224 heavy debt load in early 2017 the puerto rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to 70 billion at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4 unemployment that is more than twice the mainland u.s average 225 the debt had been increasing during a decade long recession 27 the commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts including bonds since 2015 with debt payments due the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system 226 227 without action before april puerto rico’s ability to execute contracts for fiscal year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened thereby putting at risk beginning july 1 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor u.s citizens living in puerto rico according to a letter sent to congress by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of health and human services they also said that congress must enact measures recommended by both republicans and democrats that fix puerto rico’s inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth 227 initially the oversight board created under promesa called for puerto rico s governor ricardo rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by january 28 just before that deadline the control board gave the commonwealth government until february 28 to present a fiscal plan including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt to solve the problems a moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to may 31 27 it is essential for puerto rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under promesa 228 an internal survey conducted by the puerto rican economists association revealed that the majority of puerto rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the board and the rosselló government with more than 80 of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt 229 in early august 2017 the island s financial oversight board created by promesa planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees down from the original plan of four days per month the latter had been expected to achieve 218 million in savings governor rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10 reduction in benefits to begin addressing the 50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities 30

rico government-debt crisis budget of the government of puerto rico and public debt of puerto rico puerto rico has an operating budget of about us 9.8 billion with expenses at about 10.4 billion creating a structural deficit of 775 million about 7.9 of the budget 236 the practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 17 consecutive years starting in 2000 throughout those years including present time all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover said projected deficits rather than make proper adjustments this practice eroded puerto rico s treasury as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973 w 238 the 2012 budget of the government of puerto rico projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of 71b or about 70 of puerto rico s gross domestic product this sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after puerto rico s general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade junk status by three credit rating agencies in terms of financial control almost 9.6 —or about 1.5 billion—of puerto rico s central government budget expenses for fy2014 is expected to be spent on debt service x harsher budget cuts are expected as puerto rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following years needs update for practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects a general budget which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the department of treasury of puerto rico and the consolidated budget which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget by puerto rico s government-owned corporations by revenue expected from loans by the sale of government bonds by subsidies extended by the federal government of the united states and by other funds both budgets contrast each other drastically with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget currently 29b and 9.0b respectively almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from u.s federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31 of the consolidated budget the critical aspects come from the sale of bonds which comprise 7 of the consolidated budget a ratio that increased annually due to the government s inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses in particular the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt as not a single one is self-sufficient all of them carrying extremely inefficient operations for example in fy2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than 1.3b with the puerto rico highways and transportation authority prhta reporting losses of 409m the puerto rico electric power authority prepa the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island reporting losses of 272m while the puerto rico aqueducts and sewers authority prasa the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island reported losses of 112m 240 losses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40 of puerto rico s entire public debt today 241 holistically from fy2000–fy2010 puerto rico s debt grew at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 9 while gdp remained stagnant 242 this has not always provided a long-term solution in early july 2017 for example the prepa power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure 9 billion in bond debt the agency planned to seek court protection 243 in terms of protocol the governor together with the puerto rico office of management and budget ogp in spanish formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year he then submits this formulation as a budget request to the puerto rican legislature before july 1 the date established by law as the beginning of puerto rico s fiscal year while the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted at the beginning of each regular session the request is typically submitted during the first week of may as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in january and it would be unpractical to submit a request so far ahead once submitted the budget is then approved by the legislature typically with amendments through a joint resolution and referred back to the governor for his approval the governor then either approves it or vetoes it if vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governor s approval or approve it without the governor s consent by two-thirds of the bodies of each chamber 244 once approved the department of treasury disburses funds to the office of management and budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies all while the puerto rico government development bank the government s intergovernmental bank manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government-owned corporations cost of living a map of jones act carrier routes for puerto rico the cost of living in puerto rico is high and has increased over the past decade y 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 san juan s in particular is higher than atlanta dallas and seattle but lower than boston chicago and new york city 253 one factor is housing prices which are comparable to miami and los angeles although property taxes are considerably lower than most places in the united states z statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs such as the high cost of electricity which has hovered in the 24¢ to 30¢ range per kilowatt hour two to three times the national average increased travel costs for longer flights additional shipping fees and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the continental united states while some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to puerto rico many merchants exclude hawaii alaska puerto rico and other united states territories the household median income is stated as 19,350 and the mean income as 30,463 in the us census bureau s 2015 update the report also indicates that 45.5 of individuals are below the poverty level 255 the median home value in puerto rico ranges from us 100,000 to us 214,000 while the national median home value sits at 119,600 aa one of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in puerto rico is the merchant marine act of 1920 also known as the jones act which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two american ports a practice known as cabotage 257 because of the jones act foreign ships inbound with goods from central and south america western europe and africa cannot stop in puerto rico offload puerto rico-bound goods load mainland-bound puerto rico-manufactured goods and continue to u.s ports instead they must proceed directly to u.s ports where distributors break bulk and send puerto rico-bound manufactured goods to puerto rico across the ocean by u.s.-flagged ships 257 the local government of puerto rico has requested several times to the u.s congress to exclude puerto rico from the jones act restrictions without success ab the most recent measure has been taken by the 17th legislative assembly of puerto rico through r conc del s 21 259 260 these measures have always received support from all the major local political parties in 2013 the government accountability office published a report which concluded that repealing or amending the jones act cabotage law might cut puerto rico shipping costs and that shippers believed that opening the trade to non-u.s.-flag competition could lower costs ac ad however the same gao report also found that shippers doing business in puerto rico that gao contacted reported that the freight rates are often—although not always—lower for foreign carriers going to and from puerto rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship similar cargo to and from the united states despite longer distances data were not available to allow us to validate the examples given or verify the extent to which this difference occurred 262 ultimately the report concluded that the effects of modifying the application of the jones act for puerto rico are highly uncertain for both puerto rico and the united states particularly for the u.s shipping industry and the military preparedness of the united states 261 262 demographics main articles demographics of puerto rico and cultural diversity in puerto rico population density census 2000 the population of

continue to follow a pattern of circular migration with some migrants returning to the island in recent years the population has declined markedly falling nearly 1 in 2012 and an additional 1 36,000

nadir port 12 a problem during progress approach to the space station forced cosmonauts on the station to intervene during station-keeping as part of the rendezvous operations flight controllers in moscow instructed cosmonaut alexander kaleri to activate the toru manual docking equipment and take over the piloting tasks from the progress autonomous kurs system the switch to manual mode was decided at range of 194 m kaleri worked inside the space station s zvezda module to fly progress m-08m remotely using television views and a pair of joysticks and guided it to the successful docking

portable multipurpose workstation in plane iv in the zvezda large diameter and installed struts between poisk module and zvezda module and poisk module and zarya module they performed an experiment called test which was aimed at verifying the existence of micro organisms or contamination underneath insulation on the russian segment of the iss yurchikhin and skripochka photographed and installed the protective cover and disconnected and removed the plasma pulse injector science hardware from the portable multipurpose workstation in plane ii of the zvezda they cleaned the kontur science hardware rokviss with dry towels and then disconnected and then removed it yurchikhin and skripochka also installed the protective cover and disconnected and removed the expose-r scientific experiment from the portable multipurpose workstation in plane ii of the zvezda module the kontur experiment studied remote object control capability for robotic arms and the expose-r experiment is a european space agency experiment designed to expose organic material to the extreme environment of space yurchikhin and skripochka installed an oft hand-rail on pirs docking module and installed the skk 1-m2 cassette on poisk module 14 the cosmonauts also removed a television camera from the rassvet module however they were unsuccessful in relocating the camera due to interference with insulation where it was to be installed 15 ‡ denotes spacewalks performed from the pirs docking compartment in russian orlan suits

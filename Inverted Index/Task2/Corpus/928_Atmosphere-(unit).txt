atmosphere unit wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the standard atmosphere symbol atm is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 pa 1.01325 bar it is sometimes used as a reference or standard pressure history edit in 1954 the 10th conférence générale des poids et mesures cgpm adopted standard atmosphere for general use and affirmed its definition of being precisely equal to 1,013,250 dynes per square centimetre 101325 pa 1 this value was intended to represent the mean atmospheric pressure at mean sea level at the latitude of paris france citation needed and does reflect the mean sea level pressure for many industrialized nations that are at broadly similar latitudes in chemistry and in various industries the reference pressure referred to in “standard temperature and pressure” stp was commonly 1 atm 101.325 kpa but standards have since diverged in 1982 the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac recommended that for the purposes of specifying the physical properties of substances “standard pressure” should be precisely 100 kpa 1 bar 2 pressure units and equivalencies edit pressure units v t e pascal bar technical atmosphere standard atmosphere torr pounds per square inch pa bar at atm torr psi 1 pa ≡ 1 n m2 10−5 6995101970000000000♠1.0197×10−5 6994986919999999999♠9.8692×10−6 6997750060000000000♠7.5006×10−3 6996145037700000000♠1.450377×10−4 1 bar 105 ≡ 100 kpa ≡ 106 dyn cm2 7000101970000000000♠1.0197 6999986920000000000♠0.98692 7002750060000000000♠750.06 7001145037700000000♠14.50377 1 at 7004980665000000000♠9.80665×104 6999980665000000000♠0.980665 ≡ 1 kp cm2 6999967841100000000♠0.9678411 7002735559200000000♠735.5592 7001142233400000000♠14.22334 1 atm 7005101325000000000♠1.01325×105 7000101325000000000♠1.01325 7000103319999999999♠1.0332 1 ≡ 7002760000000000000♠760 7001146959500000000♠14.69595 1 torr 7002133322399999999♠133.3224 6997133322400000000♠1.333224×10−3 6997135955100000000♠1.359551×10−3 ≡ 1 760 ≈ 6997131578900000000♠1.315789×10−3 ≡ 1 torr ≈ 1 mmhg 6998193367800000000♠1.933678×10−2 1 psi 7003689480000000000♠6.8948×103 6998689480000000000♠6.8948×10−2 6998703069000000000♠7.03069×10−2 6998680460000000000♠6.8046×10−2 7001517149300000000♠51.71493 ≡ 1 lbf in2 a pressure of 1 atm can also be stated as ≡ 1.01325 bar ≡ 101325 pascal pa or 101.325 kilopascal kpa ≡ 1013.25 millibars mbar also mb ≡ 760 torr n 1 ≈ 760.001 mm-hg 0 °c subject to revision as more precise measurements of mercury’s density become available n 2 n 3 ≈ 29.9213 in-hg 0 °c subject to revision as more precise measurements of mercury’s density become available n 3 ≈ 1.033 227 452 799 886 kgf cm² ≈ 1.033 227 452 799 886 technical atmosphere ≈ 1033.227 452 799 886 cm–h2o 4 °c n 2 ≈ 406.782 461 732 2385 in–h2o 4 °c n 2 ≈ 14.695 948 775 5134 pounds-force per square inch psi ≈ 2116.216 623 673 94 pounds-force per square foot psf 1 ata atmosphere absolute the ata unit is used in place of atm to indicate that the pressure shown is the total ambient pressure compared to vacuum of the system being calculated or measured 3 for example for underwater pressures a pressure of 3.1 ata would mean that the 1 atm of the air above water is included in this value and the pressure due to water would total 2.1 atm notes torr and mm-hg 0°c are often taken to be identical for most practical purposes to 5 significant digits they are interchangeable a b c this is the customarily accepted value for cm–h2o 4 °c it is precisely the product of 1 kg-force per square centimeter one technical atmosphere times 1.013 25 bar atmosphere divided by 0.980 665 one gram-force it is not accepted practice to define the value for water column based on a true physical realization of water which would be 99.997 495 of this value because the true maximum density of vienna standard mean ocean water is 0.999 974 95 kg l at 3.984 °c also this “physical realization” would still ignore the 8.285 cm–h2o reduction that would actually occur in a true physical realization due to the vapor pressure over water at 3.984 °c a b nist value of 13.595 078 5 g ml assumed for the density of hg at 0 °c other applications edit scuba divers and others use the word atmosphere and atm in relation to pressures that are relative to mean atmospheric pressure at sea level 1.013 bar citation needed for example a partial pressure of oxygen is calibrated typically using air at sea level so is expressed in units of atm the old european unit technical atmosphere at is equal to 1 kilogram-force per square centimetre kgf cm2 7004980665000000000♠98066.5 pa citation needed

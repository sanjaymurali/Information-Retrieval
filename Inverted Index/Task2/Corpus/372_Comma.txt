several variants in various languages it has the same shape as an apostrophe or single closing quotation mark in many typefaces but it differs from them in being placed on the baseline of the text some typefaces render it as a small line slightly curved or straight but inclined from the vertical or with the appearance of a small filled-in numeral 9 the comma is used in many contexts and languages mainly for separating parts of a sentence such as clauses and items in lists particularly when there are three or more items listed the word comma comes from the greek κόμμα kómma which originally meant a cut-off piece specifically in grammar a short clause 1 2 a comma-shaped mark is used as a diacritic in several writing systems and is considered distinct from the cedilla the rough and smooth breathings ἁ ἀ appear above the letter in ancient greek and the comma diacritic appears below the letter in latvian romanian and livonian comma variants edit this section contains uncommon

system of single dots distinctiones that separated verses colometry and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of text when reading aloud 3 the different lengths were signified by a dot at the bottom middle or top of the line for a short passage a komma a media distinctio dot was placed mid-level  ·  this is the origin of the concept of a comma although the name came to be used for the mark itself instead of the clause it separated the mark used today is descended from a diagonal slash or virgula suspensiva     used from the 13th to 17th centuries to represent a pause the modern comma was first used by aldus manutius 4 5 uses in english edit in general the comma shows that the words immediately before the comma are less closely or exclusively linked grammatically to those immediately after the comma than they might be otherwise the comma performs a number of functions in english writing it is used in generally similar ways in other languages particularly european ones although the rules on comma usage – and their rigidity – vary from language to language in lists edit commas are placed between items in lists as in they own a cat a dog two rabbits and seven mice some english style guides recommend that a comma be used before the final conjunction and or nor in a list of more than two elements a comma used in such a position is variously called a serial comma an oxford comma or a harvard comma after the oxford university press and harvard university press both prominent advocates of this style such use of a comma sometimes prevents ambiguity the sentence i spoke to the boys sam and tom could mean either i spoke to the boys and sam and tom i spoke to more than three people or i spoke to the boys who are sam and tom i spoke to two people i spoke to the boys sam and tom – must be the boys and sam and tom i spoke to more than three people the serial comma does not eliminate all confusion consider the following sentence i thank my mother anne smith and thomas this could mean either my mother and anne smith and thomas three people or my mother who is anne smith and thomas two people this sentence might be recast as my mother anne smith and thomas for clarity i thank my mother anne smith and thomas because the comma after mother is conventionally used to prepare the reader for an apposite phrase – that is a renaming of or further information about a noun – this construction suggests that my mother s name is anne smith and thomas compare i thank my friend smith and wesson in which the ambiguity is obvious as a rule of thumb the guardian style guide 6 suggests that straightforward lists he ate ham eggs and chips do not need a comma before the final and but sometimes it can help the reader he ate cereal kippers bacon eggs toast and marmalade and tea the chicago manual of style and other academic writing guides require the serial comma all lists must have a comma before the and prefacing the last item in a series if the individual items of a list are long complex affixed with description or themselves contain commas semicolons may be preferred as separators and the list may be introduced with a colon in news headlines a comma might replace the word and even if there are only two items in order to save space as in this headline from reuters 7 trump macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy separation of clauses edit commas are often used to separate clauses in english a comma is used to separate a dependent clause from the independent clause if the dependent clause comes first after i fed the cat i brushed my clothes compare this with i brushed my clothes after i fed the cat a relative clause takes commas if it is non-restrictive as in i cut down all the trees which were over six feet tall without the comma this would mean that only those trees over six feet tall were cut down some style guides prescribe that two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction for and nor but or yet so must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction 8 9 in the following sentences where the second clause is independent because it can stand alone as a sentence the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary mary walked to the party but she was unable to walk home designer clothes are silly and i can t afford them anyway don t push that button or twelve tons of high explosives will go off right under our feet in the following sentences where the second half of the sentence is not an independent clause because it does not contain an explicit subject those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted mary walked to the party but was unable to walk home i think designer clothes are silly and can t afford them anyway however such guides permit the comma to be omitted if the second independent clause is very short typically when the second independent clause is an imperative 8 9 as in sit down and shut up the above guidance is not universally accepted or applied long coordinating clauses are nonetheless usually separated by commas 10 she had very little to live on but she would never have dreamed of taking what was not hers in some languages such as german and polish stricter rules apply on comma usage between clauses with dependent clauses always being set off with commas and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions the joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction as in it is nearly half past five we cannot reach town before dark is known as a comma splice and is sometimes considered an error in english 11 in most cases a semicolon should be used instead a comma splice should not be confused though with asyndeton a literary device used for a specific effect in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted certain adverbs edit commas are always used to set off certain adverbs at the beginning of a sentence including however in fact therefore nevertheless moreover furthermore and still therefore a comma would be appropriate in this sentence nevertheless i will not use one if these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence they are followed and preceded by a comma as in the second of the two below examples if the two sentences are separated by a semicolon and the second sentence starts with an adverb then it is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma in this sentence furthermore commas would also be called for this sentence is similar however a semicolon is necessary as well using commas to offset certain adverbs is optional including then so yet instead and too meaning also so that s it for this rule or so that s it for this rule a comma would be appropriate in this sentence too or a comma would be appropriate in this sentence too parenthetical phrases edit commas are often used to enclose parenthetical words and phrases within a sentence i.e. information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence the following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases introductory phrase once upon a time my father ate a muffin 12 interjection my father ate the muffin gosh darn it aside my father if you don t mind me telling you this ate the muffin appositive my father a jaded and bitter man ate the muffin absolute phrase my father his eyes flashing with rage ate the muffin free modifier my father chewing with unbridled fury ate the muffin resumptive modifier my father ate the muffin a muffin which no man had yet chewed summative modifier my father ate the muffin a feat which no man had attempted between adjectives edit a comma is used to separate coordinate adjectives i.e. adjectives that directly and equally modify the following noun adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if and were placed between them for example the dull incessant droning but the cute little cottage the devious lazy red frog suggests there are lazy red frogs one of which is devious while the devious lazy red frog does not carry this connotation before quotations edit some writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma as in mr kershner says you should know how to use a comma quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a colon rather than a comma other writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway thus they would write mr kershner says you should know how to use a comma in dates edit month day year edit when a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year a comma separates the day from the year december 19 1941 this style is common in american english the comma is used to avoid confusing consecutive numbers december 19 1941 most style manuals including the chicago manual of style 13 and the ap stylebook 14 also recommend that the year be treated as a parenthetical requiring a second comma after it feb 14 1987 was the target date if just month and year are given no commas are used 15 her daughter april may return in june 2009 for the reunion day month year edit when the day precedes the month the month name separates the numeric day and year so commas are not necessary to separate them the raid on alexandria was carried out on 19 december 1941 in geographical names edit commas are used to separate parts of geographical references such as city and state dallas texas or city and country kampala uganda additionally most style manuals including the chicago manual of style 16 and the ap stylebook 17 recommend that the second element be treated as a parenthetical requiring a second comma after the plane landed in kampala uganda that evening 18 the united states postal service 19 and royal mail 20 recommend leaving out punctuation when writing addresses on actual letters and packages as the marks hinder optical character recognition in numbers edit main article decimal mark in representing large numbers from the right side to the left english texts usually use commas to separate each group of three digits in front of the decimal this is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits and often for five or four digits but not in front of the number itself however in much of europe southern africa and latin america periods or spaces are used instead the comma is used as a decimal separator equivalent to the use in english of the decimal point in india the groups are two digits except for the rightmost group however the comma may not be used for this purpose at all in some styles e.g the si writing style 21 a space may be used to separate groups of three digits instead in names edit commas are used when writing names that are presented surname first generally in instances of alphabetization by surname smith john they are also used before many titles that follow a name john smith ph.d the big final rule for the comma is one that you won t find in any books by grammarians .. don t use commas like a stupid person  lynne truss eats shoots and leaves 22 similarly in lists that are presented with an inversion . socks green 3

was vocative edit commas are placed before after or around a noun or pronoun used independently in speaking to some person place or thing i hope john that you will read this between the subject and predicate edit in his 1785 essay on punctuation joseph robertson advocated a comma between the subject and predicate of long sentences for clarity however this usage is regarded as an error in modern times the good taste of the present age has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the english language whoever is capable of forgetting a benefit is an enemy to society differences between american and british usage edit the comma and the quotation mark pairing can be used in several ways in american english the comma is commonly included inside a quotation mark 24 25 my mother gave me the nickname bobby bobby bob bob boy which really made me angry in great britain and many other parts of the world punctuation is usually placed within quotation marks only if it is part of what is being quoted or referred to 24 25 26 my mother gave me the nickname bobby bobby bob bob boy which really made me angry there is also some difference regarding the use of the serial comma which is an optional comma placed before the coordinating conjunction in a list of three or more items they served apples peaches and bananas serial comma used we cleaned up cores pits and skins serial comma omitted the serial comma is also known as the oxford comma harvard comma or series comma it is sometimes perceived as overly careful or an americanism citation needed but its usage occurs within both american and british english it is called the oxford comma because of its long history of use by oxford university press 27 opinions among writers and editors differ on whether to use the serial comma a majority of american style guides mandate use of the serial comma including the chicago manual of style strunk and white s the elements of style and the u.s government printing office style manual the ap stylebook for journalistic writing advises against it it is used less often in british english but some british style guides require it including the oxford university press style manual and fowler s modern english usage some writers of british english use it only where necessary to avoid ambiguity according to new hart s rules house style will dictate whether to use the serial comma and the general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently no association with region or dialect is suggested other than that its use has been strongly advocated by oxford university press 28 barbara child advises that it is a good idea to put a comma before the last item in a series but claims that in the united states there is a trend toward a decreased use of the comma generally 29 this is reinforced by an article by robert j samuelson in newsweek 30 lynne truss says that general decline in usage of commas is equally true in the uk where it has been a slow steady trend for at least a century nowadays .. a passage peppered with commas—which in the past would have indicated painstaking and authoritative editorial attention—smacks simply of no backbone people who put in all the commas betray themselves as moral weaklings with empty lives and out-of-date reference books truss 2004 pp 97–98 in his 1963 book of spies and stratagems stanley p lovell recalls that during the second world war the british carried the comma over into abbreviations specifically special operations executive was written s.o.,e nowadays even the full stops are frequently discarded in other languages edit punctuation has been added to many languages which originally developed without it including a number of different comma forms european languages like german french italian spanish and portuguese use the same comma as english with similar spacing though usage may be somewhat different for instance in standard german subordinate clauses are always preceded by commas modern greek uses the same unicode comma for its kómma κόμμα 31 and it is officially romanized as a latin comma 32 but it has additional roles owing to its conflation with the former hypodiastole a curved interpunct used to disambiguate certain homonyms the comma therefore functions as a silent letter in a handful of greek words principally distinguishing ό,τι ó,ti whatever from ότι óti that 31

cedilla is occasionally used instead of it notably in the unicode glyph names but this is technically incorrect the symbol d̦ d with comma below was used as part of the romanian transitional alphabet 19th century to indicate the sounds denoted by the latin letter z or letters dz where derived from a cyrillic ѕ dz the comma and the cedilla are both derivative of a small cursive z ʒ placed below the letter from this standpoint alone ș ț and d̦ could potentially be regarded as stand-ins for sz tz and dz respectively in latvian the comma is used on the letters ģ ķ ļ ņ and historically also ŗ to

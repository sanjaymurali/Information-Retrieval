call name or call letters—and historically as a call signal—or abbreviated as a call is a unique designation for a transmitter station in north america they are used for all fcc-licensed transmitters 1 a call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency informally adopted by individuals or organizations or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station s identity the use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram in order to save time two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose this pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea these were not globally unique so a one-letter company identifier for instance m and two letters as a marconi station was later added by 1912 the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard an itu prefix would be used to identify a country and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country 2 transportation edit maritime edit russian nuclear icebreaker arktika with call sign ukty main article maritime call signs merchant and naval vessels are assigned call signs by their national licensing authorities in the case of states such as liberia or panama which are flags of convenience for ship registration call signs for larger vessels consist of the national prefix plus three letters for example 3lxy and sometimes followed by a number i.e 3lxy2 united states merchant vessels are given call signs beginning with the letters w or k while us naval ships are assigned callsigns beginning with n originally both ships and broadcast stations were given call signs in this series consisting of three or four letters but as demand for both marine radio and broadcast call signs grew gradually american-flagged vessels were given longer call signs with mixed letters and numbers leisure craft with vhf radios may not be assigned call signs in which case the name of the vessel is used instead ships in the us wishing to have a radio licence anyway are under fcc class sa ship recreational or voluntarily equipped those calls follow the land mobile format of the initial letter k or w followed by 1 or 2 letters followed by 3 or 4 numbers such as kx0983 or wxx0029 u.s coast guard small boats have a number that is shown on both bows i.e port and starboard in which the first two digits indicate the nominal length of the boat in feet for example coast guard 47021 refers to the 21st in the series of 47-foot motor lifeboats the call sign might be abbreviated to the final two or three numbers during operations for example coast guard zero two one aviation edit main article aviation call signs call signs in aviation are derived from several different policies depending upon the type of flight operation and whether or not the caller is in an aircraft or at a ground facility in most countries unscheduled general aviation flights identify themselves using the call sign corresponding to the aircraft s registration number also called n-number in the u.s. or tail number in this case the call sign is spoken using the international civil aviation organization icao phonetic alphabet aircraft registration numbers internationally follow the pattern of a country prefix followed by a unique identifier made up of letters and numbers for example an aircraft registered as n978cp conducting a general aviation flight would use the call sign november-niner-seven-eight-charlie-papa however in the united states a pilot of an aircraft would normally omit saying november and instead use the name of the aircraft manufacturer or the specific model at times general aviation pilots might omit additional preceding numbers and use only the last three numbers and letters this is especially true at uncontrolled fields those without control towers when reporting traffic pattern positions or at towered airports after establishing two-way communication with the tower controller for example skyhawk eight-charlie-papa left base in most countries the aircraft call sign or tail number tail letters also known as registration marks are linked to the international radio call sign allocation table and follow a convention that aircraft radio stations and by extension the aircraft itself receive call signs consisting of five letters for example all british civil aircraft have a five-letter call sign beginning with the letter g canadian aircraft have a call sign beginning with c–f or c–g such as c–fabc wing in ground-effect vehicles hovercraft in canada are eligible to receive c–hxxx call signs and ultralight aircraft receive c-ixxx call signs in days gone by even american aircraft used five letter call signs such as kh–abc but they were replaced prior to world war ii by the current american system of civilian aircraft call signs see below spaceflight edit main article spacecraft call signs radio call signs used for communication in manned spaceflight is not formalized or regulated to the same degree as for aircraft the three nations currently launching manned space missions use different methods to identify the ground and space radio stations the united states uses either the names given to the space vehicles or else the project name and mission number russia traditionally assigns code names as call signs to individual cosmonauts more in the manner of aviator call signs rather than to the spacecraft the only continuity in call signs for spacecraft have been the issuance of iss suffixed call signs by various countries in the amateur radio service as a citizen of their country has been assigned there the first amateur radio call sign assigned to the international space station was na1ss by the united states or4iss denmark dp0iss germany and rs0iss russia are examples of others but are not all-inclusive of others also issued broadcasting edit a 1940 qsl card for wwv

philadelphia and kdka in pittsburgh stations in the central united states use call signs beginning with either k or w all new call signs have been 4-character for some decades though there are historical 3-character call letters still in use today such as ksl in salt lake city koa in denver who in des moines wjw in cleveland wsm in nashville and wgn in chicago american radio stations announce their call signs at the top of each hour as well as sign-on and sign-off for stations that do not broadcast 24 hours in canada the publicly owned canadian broadcasting corporation use the

personal identifier such as p portable m mobile am aeronautical mobile or mm maritime mobile the number following the prefix is normally a single number 0 to 9 some prefixes such as djibouti s j2 consist of a letter followed by a number hence in the hypothetical djibouti call sign j29dba the prefix is j2 the number is 9 and the suffix is dba others may start with a number followed by a letter for example jamaican call signs begin with 6y when operating with reciprocal agreements under the jurisdiction of a foreign government an identifying station pre-pends the call sign with the country prefix and number of the country territory from which the operation is occurring for example w4 g3abc would denote a licensed amateur from the united kingdom who is operating in the fourth district of the united states there are exceptions in the case of u.s canadian reciprocal operations the country territory identifier is instead appended to the call sign e.g. w1aw ve4 or ve3xyz w1 special call

military call signs in wartime monitoring an adversary s communications can be a valuable form of intelligence consistent call signs can aid in this monitoring so in wartime military units often employ tactical call signs and sometimes change them at regular intervals in peacetime some military stations will use fixed call signs in the international series the united states army uses fixed station call signs which begin with w such as war used by u.s army headquarters fixed call signs for the united states air force stations begin with a such as air used by usaf headquarters the united states navy united states marine corps and united states coast guard use a mixture of tactical call signs and international call signs beginning with the letter n in the british military tactical voice communications use a system of call signs of the form letter-digit-digit within a standard infantry battalion these characters represent companies platoons and sections respectively so that 3 section 1 platoon of f company might be f13 in addition a suffix following the initial call sign can denote a specific individual or grouping within the designated call sign so f13c would be the charlie fire team unused suffixes can be used for other call signs that do not fall into the standard call sign matrix for example the unused 33a call sign is used to refer to the company sergeant major transmitters requiring no call signs edit no call signs are issued to transmitters of long-range navigation systems decca alpha omega or transmitters on frequencies below 10 khz because frequencies below 10 khz are not subject to international regulations in addition in some countries lawful unlicensed low-power personal and broadcast radio signals citizen s band part 15 or ism bands are permitted an international call sign is not issued to such stations due to their unlicensed nature also wireless network routers or mobile devices and computers using wi-fi are unlicensed and do not have call signs on some personal radio services such as citizen s band it is considered a matter of etiquette to create one s own call sign which is called a handle or trail name some wireless networking protocols also allow an ssid or a mac address to be set as an identifier but with no guarantee that this label will remain unique international regulations no longer require a call sign for broadcast stations however they are still required for broadcasters in many countries including the united states mobile phone services do not use call signs on-air for obvious reasons the phones and their users are not licensed instead the cell operator is however the u.s still assigns a call sign to each mobile-phone spectrum license in the united states voluntary ships operating domestically are not required to have a call sign or license to operate vhf radios radar or a distress radiobeacon voluntary ships mostly pleasure and recreational are not required to have a radio however ships which are required to have radio equipment most large commercial vessels are issued a call sign 4 callbooks edit fcc callbook 1919 a directory of radio station call signs is called a callbook callbooks were originally bound books that resembled a telephone directory and contains the name and addressees of licensed radio stations in a given jurisdiction country modern electrics published the first callbook in the united states in 1909 5 today the primary purpose of a callbook is to allow amateur radio operators to send a confirmation post card called a qsl card to an operator who they have communicated via radio callbooks have evolved to include on-line databases that are accessible via the internet to instantly obtain the address of another amateur radio operator and their qsl managers the most well known and used on-line qsl databases include qrz.com 6 ik3qar 7 hamcall 8 f6cyv 9 dxinfo 10 oz7c 11 and qslinfo 12

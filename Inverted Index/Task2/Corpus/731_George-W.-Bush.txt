nevertheless public support for the proposal declined 149 and the house republican leadership decided not to put social security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda 150 the proposal s legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from hurricane katrina 151 after the democrats gained control of both houses of congress

hawaiian islands a national monument creating the largest marine reserve to date the papahānaumokuākea marine national monument comprises 84 million acres 340,000 km2 and is home to 7,000 species of

bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production 165 amid high gasoline prices in 2008 bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling 166 however the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling bush said this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil reserves is action from the u.s congress 166 bush had said in june 2008 in the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies my administration has worked with congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells.. in the short run the american economy will continue to rely largely on oil and that means we need to increase supply especially here at home so my administration has repeatedly called on congress to expand domestic oil production 167 in his 2008 state of the union address bush announced that the u.s would commit 2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change saying along

the department of health and human services and the national institutes of health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the dickey-wicker amendment by congress and the signature of president bill clinton 169 bush has said that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research however bush did not support embryonic stem cell research 170 on august 9 2001 bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing lines of stem cells 171 but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines 172 on july 19 2006 bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the stem cell research enhancement act the bill would have repealed the dickey-wicker amendment thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo 173

series of border and work site enforcement measures a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based merit system for green cards elimination of chain migration and of the diversity immigrant visa and other measures bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of u.s laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor 180 bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty 181 a heated public debate followed which resulted in a substantial rift within the republican party most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions 182 the bill was eventually defeated in the senate on june 28 2007 when a cloture motion

effort up to that point was not enough 194 as the disaster in new orleans intensified critics charged that bush was misrepresenting his administration s role in what they saw as a flawed response leaders attacked bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at fema notably michael d brown 195 it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the iraq war 196 and bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods 197 198 199 bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government s failures in its

iraq was arming to threaten the peace of the world and pose d a grave and growing danger 233 the bush administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war or preventive war

remained highly classified 275 once the department of justice office of legal counsel questioned its original legal opinion that fisa did not apply in a time of war the program was subsequently re-authorized by the president on the basis that the warrant requirements of fisa were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the authorization for use of military force against terrorists 276 the program proved to be controversial as critics of the administration as well as organizations such as the american bar association argued that it was illegal 277 in august 2006 a u.s district court judge ruled that the nsa electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional 278 but on july 6 2007 that ruling was vacated by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit on the

it in the bybee memo from the attorney general though that memo was later withdrawn 289 while not permitted by the u.s army field manuals which assert that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information 287 the bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations provided critical information to preserve american lives 290 critics such as former cia officer bob baer have stated that information was suspect you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture s bad enough 291 on october 17 2006 bush signed into law the military commissions act of 2006 292 a law enacted in the wake of the supreme court s decision in hamdan v rumsfeld 548 u.s 557 2006 293 which allows the u.s government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than

states and the world 233 bush condemned north korea s position reaffirmed his commitment to a nuclear-free korean peninsula and stated that transfer of nuclear weapons or material by north korea to

united states great lakes region canada part of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season hurricane ike pronounced ˈaɪk was a powerful tropical cyclone that swept through portions of the greater antilles and northern america in september 2008 wreaking havoc on infrastructure and agriculture particularly in cuba and texas other locations were also seriously affected by ike which was ultimately the third-costliest of any atlantic hurricane and resulted in 37.5 billion in damages with only hurricanes sandy 2012 and katrina 2005 estimated higher ike developed from a tropical wave west of cape verde on september 1 nb 1 and strengthened to a peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane over the open waters of the central atlantic on september 4 as it tracked westward several fluctuations in strength occurred before ike made landfall on eastern cuba on september 8 the hurricane weakened prior to continuing into the gulf of mexico but increased its intensity by the time of its final landfall on galveston texas on september 13 the remnants of ike continued to track across the united states and into canada causing considerable damage inland before dissipating two days later ike was blamed for at least 195 deaths of these deaths 74 were in haiti which was already trying to recover from the impact of three storms fay gustav and hanna which had made landfall that same year seven people were killed in cuba by ike 1 in the united states 113 people were reported killed directly or indirectly and 16 were still missing as of august 2011 2 due to its immense size ike caused devastation from the louisiana coastline all the way to the kenedy county region near corpus christi texas 3 in addition ike caused flooding and significant damage along the mississippi coastline and the florida panhandle 4 damages from ike in u.s coastal and inland areas are estimated at 29.5 billion 2008 usd 2 with additional damage of 7.3 billion in cuba the costliest storm ever in that country 200 million in the bahamas and 500 million in the turks and caicos amounting to a total of at least 37.5 billion in damage ike is currently the third-costliest atlantic hurricane of all time only surpassed by hurricane katrina in 2005 and later by hurricane sandy in 2012 5 though initial cost estimates for hurricanes harvey 6 7 and irma 8 9 10 11 12 13 indicate both will surpass ike the search-and-rescue operation after ike is the largest search-and-rescue operation in texas history 14 ike was the third major hurricane of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season 2 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the origins of hurricane ike can be traced back to a well-defined tropical wave first identified by the national hurricane center  nhc just within the western coast of africa on august 28 15 16 despite the development of a low-pressure area associated with the wave and signs of organization within favorable conditions near the cape verde islands 17 the system was only able to generate intermittent thunderstorm activity the broad low-pressure continued to track westward and was considered to have become sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression at 06 00 utc on september 1 by this time the cyclone had tracked 780 miles 1,260 kilometers west of cape verde although post-analysis indicated that the depression reached tropical storm strength at 12 00 utc that day 18 operationally the nhc began issuing advisories on ike three hours later by which time the system had already gained numerous curved rainbands and well-established outflow 19 over the next few hours ike developed additional rainbands 20 but failed to a centralized area of convection due to the presence of dry air to the storm s south and its location in an area with only marginally favorable sea surface temperatures 21 these factors were also responsible for ike s slow developmental trend that began after formation 18 meteorological prediction of ike s path on september 3 2008 ike s gradual strengthening began to quicken early on september 3 with the strengthening of an intense rainband around the center of the storm at roughly 15 00 utc that day microwave imaging indicated that a primordial eye was developing within the intensifying tropical storm 18 tracking northwestward the nhc upgraded ike to hurricane status at 18 00 utc based on objective satellite intensity estimates and the appearance of the eye on visible satellite imagery 18 22 during this time ike was centered 690 mi 1,110 km east-northeast of the leeward islands and was tracking west-northwestward as a result of a weakened subtropical ridge to its northeast 18 ike s placement in an area with virtually no wind shear allowed for the hurricane to undergo explosive intensification despite unfavorable upper-level winds to its north 22 reaching major hurricane strength six hours after its designation as a hurricane 23 at 06 00 utc on september 4 ike peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour 233 kilometers per hour and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 millibars 27.6 inches of mercury making the storm a category 4 on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale after peaking in strength a ridge of high pressure to the storm s west strengthened causing ike to track towards the southwest—a path unusual for the time of year however this track also brought the storm into an area of strong wind shear 18 causing the storm to become asymmetric in structure late on september 4 and weaken 24 briefly dropping below major hurricane status on september 6 while 150 miles 240 km east of grand turk island 25 although wind shear abated and allowed for reintensification ike would fluctuate in strength over the next few days after passing near the turks and caicos islands ike made its first landfall on inagua in the bahamas at 13 00 utc on september 7 with winds of 125 mph 201 km h 26 after passing over inagua 26 the development of a double eyewall—a feature that usually denotes the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle—slightly weakened ike late on september 7 27 however the hurricane was able to reintensify and reach category 4 intensity for a final time before making landfall near cabo lucrecia on the coast of holguín province in cuba by 00 00 utc the next day 26 although ike remained well-defined for most of its crossing of eastern cuba 28 the hurricane s core had become disrupted by the time it had reached the caribbean sea after spending a few hours over land 29 over the next day ike tracked westward paralleling the southern coast of cuba without much intensification at times the center of the hurricane was within 12 mi 19 km of the island at around 14 00 utc on september 9 ike made a second cuban landfall this time on punta la capitana in pinar del rio with winds of 80 mph 130 km h roughly six hours later the hurricane emerged into the gulf of mexico as a slightly weakened system 26 despite tracking back over water ike s prolonged interaction with cuba had greatly disrupted the system s core and instead of quickly strengthening and coalescing the storm s wind field instead grew and only gradual intensification ensued 26 due to the storm s comparatively small inner core and intensity of the outer rainbands 30 an eyewall replacement cycle took place preventing ike from rapidly intensifying at around the same time a high-pressure area strengthened to the hurricane s north steering the cyclone further west than initially anticipated moving over the warm waters of the loop current 26 ike reached a secondary minimum in barometric pressure on 00 00 utc with an estimate of 944 mbar 27.9 inhg though winds would continue to strengthen afterward the storm s pressure would rise 31 by late on september 12 ike had reached the western edge of the nearby high-pressure area and began to curve northward the formation of an eye just prior to landfall resulted in a slight increase in winds 26 and at 0700 utc on september 13 ike made landfall on the northeast end of galveston island in texas with a minimum barometric pressure of 950 mbar 28 inhg and sustained winds of 110 mph 180 km h making ike a category 2 hurricane 31 after tracking inland ike weakened as it sped northward and later northeastward weakening to tropical storm status east of palestine texas late on september 13 and later becoming a powerful extratropical cyclone on september 14 over the ozarks 26 a more steady weakening phase ensued and after tracking across southern ontario and quebec the remnants of ike were absorbed by another extratropical low near the st lawrence river on september 15 32 preparations edit turks and caicos and the

carolina especially in the mountains where average prices were as much as 60 cents higher than the national average 74 the closing of refineries so soon after hurricane gustav and the time required to

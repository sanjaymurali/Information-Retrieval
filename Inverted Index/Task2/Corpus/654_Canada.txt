of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of canada the name is now accepted as coming from the st lawrence iroquoian word kanata meaning village or settlement 12 in 1535 indigenous inhabitants of the present-day quebec city region used the word to direct french explorer jacques cartier to the village of stadacona 13 cartier later used the word canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to donnacona the chief at stadacona 13 by 1545 european books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the saint lawrence river as canada 13 from the 16th to the early 18th century canada referred to the part of new france that lay along the saint lawrence river 14 in 1791 the area became two british colonies called upper canada and lower canada collectively named the canadas until their union as the british province of canada in 1841 15 upon confederation in 1867 canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the london conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country s title 16 the transition away from the use of dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the canada act which refers only to canada later that year the name of the national holiday was changed from dominion day to canada day 17 the term dominion is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces though after the second world war the term federal had replaced dominion 18 history main article history of canada see also timeline of canadian history and list of years in canada further information historiography of canada indigenous peoples linguistic areas of north american indigenous peoples at the time of european contact indigenous peoples in present-day canada include the first nations inuit and métis 19 the latter being a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when first nations and inuit people married european settlers 19 the term aboriginal as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents including the constitution act 1982 20 the first inhabitants of north america migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge 21 and arrived at least 15,000 years ago though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival 22 23 24 25 the paleo-indian archeological sites at old crow flats and bluefish caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in canada 26 the characteristics of canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements agriculture complex societal hierarchies and trading networks 27 28 some of these cultures had collapsed by the time european explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations 29 the indigenous population at the time of the first european settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 30 and two million 31 with a figure of 500,000 accepted by canada s royal commission on aboriginal peoples 32 as a consequence of european colonization the population of canada s indigenous peoples declined by forty to eighty percent and several first nations such as the beothuk disappeared 33 the decline is attributed to several causes including the transfer of european diseases such as influenza measles and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity 30 34 conflicts over the fur trade conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers and the loss of indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations self-sufficiency 35 36 although not without conflict european canadians early interactions with first nations and inuit populations were relatively peaceful 37 first nations and métis peoples played a critical part in the development of european colonies in canada particularly for their role in assisting european coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the north american fur trade 38 the crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the european colonization period though the inuit in general had more limited interaction with european settlers 39 however from the late 18th century european canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture 40 these attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations 41 a period of redress is underway which started with the appointment of the truth and reconciliation commission of canada by the government of canada 42 european colonization the first known attempt at european colonization began when norsemen settled briefly at l anse aux meadows in newfoundland around 1000 ad 43 no further european exploration occurred until 1497 when italian seafarer john cabot explored and claimed canada s atlantic coast in the name of king henry vii of england 44 45 then basque and portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the atlantic coast in the early 16th century 46 in 1534 french explorer jacques cartier explored the gulf of saint lawrence where on july 24 he planted a 10-metre 33 ft cross bearing the words long live the king of france and took possession of the territory new france in the name of king francis i 47 in general the settlements appear to have been short-lived possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in scandinavia and northern canada and the problems of navigating trade routes at that time 48 in 1583 sir humphrey gilbert by the royal prerogative of queen elizabeth i founded st john s newfoundland as the first north american english colony 49 french explorer samuel de champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent european settlements at port

territory to the great lakes and ohio valley 57 it re-established the french language catholic faith and french civil law there the proclamation and the quebec act angered many residents of the thirteen colonies fuelling anti-british sentiment in the years prior to the american revolution 17 the 1783 treaty of paris recognized american independence and ceded british north american territories south of the great lakes to the new united states 58 new brunswick was split from nova scotia as part of a reorganization of loyalist settlements in the maritimes 59 to accommodate english-speaking loyalists in quebec the constitutional act of 1791 divided the province into french-speaking lower canada later quebec and english-speaking upper canada later ontario granting each its own elected legislative assembly 60 the canadas were the main front in the war of 1812 between the united states and the united kingdom peace came in 1815 no boundaries were changed immigration

united province of canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of british north america by 1849 64 the signing of the oregon treaty by britain and the united states in 1846

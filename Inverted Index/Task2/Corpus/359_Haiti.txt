that the second vowel is pronounced separately as in the word naïve 35 in english this rule for the pronunciation is often disregarded thus the spelling haiti is used there are different anglicizations for its pronunciation such as high-ti high-ee-ti and haa-ee-ti which are still in use but hay-ti is the most widespread and established 36 the name was restored by haitian revolutionary jean-jacques dessalines as the official name of independent saint-domingue as a tribute to the amerindian predecessors 37 in french haiti s nickname is the pearl of the antilles la perle des antilles

statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically because of the fact that the average haitian and haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily the disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are in the haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question for various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter for some it is because it s none of your business for others they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them 138 cité soleil in port-au-prince one of the biggest slums in the northern

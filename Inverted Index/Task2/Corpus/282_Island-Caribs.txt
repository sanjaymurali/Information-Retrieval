of the lesser antilles in the caribbean they may have descended from the mainland caribs kalina of south america but they spoke an unrelated language known as island carib at the time of spanish contact the caribs were one of the dominant groups in the caribbean which owes its name to them they lived throughout the windward islands dominica and possibly the southern leeward islands historically it was thought their ancestors were mainland caribs who conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants known as the igneri however linguistic and archaeological evidence disputes the notion of a mass emigration and conquest the island carib language appears not to have been cariban but arawakan like that of their neighbors the taíno irving rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland caribs conquered the islands without displacing their inhabitants eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a south american origin 3 in the early colonial period the caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands early europeans claimed that they practiced cannibalism – the word cannibal derives from a corruption of their name 4 today the caribs and their descendants continue to live in the antilles the garifuna or black caribs a group of mixed carib and african ancestry also live principally in central america history edit the caribs are believed to have migrated from the orinoco river area in south america to settle in the caribbean islands about 1200 ad according to carbon dating citation needed over the two centuries leading up to christopher columbus arrival in the caribbean archipelago in 1492 the caribs mostly displaced the maipurean-speaking taínos by warfare extermination and assimilation the taíno had settled the island chains earlier in history migrating from the mainland 5 greenstone ceremonial axe from shell midden mt irvine bay tobago 1957 caribs traded with the eastern taíno of the caribbean islands the caribs produced the silver products which ponce de leon found in taíno communities none of the insular amerindians mined for gold but obtained it by trade from the mainland the caribs were skilled boat builders and sailors they appeared to have owed their dominance in the caribbean basin to their mastery of warfare according to floyd the question arose in columbus s time whether indians could be enslaved and queen isabel had ruled against it at about the same time however ojeda bastidas and other explorers voyaging along the spanish main had been attacked by indians with poisoned arrows all such indians were considered caribs which took a considerable toll of spanish lives these attacks and the evidence some of the perpetrators at least were cannibals provided the rationale for the decree authorizing enslavement of caribs on 3 june 1511 king ferdinand declared war on the caribs 6 island caribs nevertheless mostly succeeded in keeping their islands unoccupied by spaniards in the 17th century island caribs were displaced with a great loss of life by a new wave of european invaders french and english most fatalities resulted from eurasian infectious diseases such as smallpox which they had no natural immunity to as well as warfare in 1660 france and england signed with island caribs the treaty of saint charles that stipulated that caribs would evacuate all the lesser antilles except for dominica and saint vincent which were recognized as reserves however the english would later ignore the treaty and ended up annexing both islands in 1763 7 to this date a small population of around 3,000 caribs survives in the carib territory in northeast dominica the black caribs later known as carifuna of st vincent st vincent has

carib and formed the last native culture to resist the british it was not until 1795 that british colonists deported the black caribs to roatan island off honduras their descendants continue to live there today and are known as the garifuna ethnic group carib resistance delayed the settlement of dominica by europeans the black carib communities that remained in st vincent and dominica retained a degree of autonomy well into the 19th century the last known speakers of island carib died in the 1930s and the language is extinct people edit the kalinago of dominica maintained their independence for many years by taking advantage of the island s rugged terrain the island s east coast includes a 3,700-acre 15 km2 territory formerly known as the carib territory that was granted to the people by the british crown in 1903 there are only 3,000 caribs remaining they elect their own chief in july 2003 the kalinago observed 100 years of territory in july 2014 charles williams was elected kalinago

were of a medium height but in general were of a taller stature than the arawaks they were described as being stronger than the arawaks reportedly due to the emphasis placed on training for warfare their skin was of a brown hue and they were usually naked and it was very rare for their loins to be covered the women painted their skin with a red dye called roucou which they used to make fantastical decorations of many colours the eyes of the females were usually circled with black the men also painted their bodies and on occasion wore feathered headdresses jewellery through their lips and jewellery through their noses they wore the caracoli which was a necklace of small bones along with the teeth of defeated enemies from which a crescent shaped ornament was suspended the caracoli was worn to represent the courage of the wearer religion edit the caribs are believed to have been polytheists as the spanish began to colonise the caribbean area they wanted to convert the natives to catholicism 12 the religion practised by the caribs had elements similar to the ancestor worship of the taíno they believed in an evil spirit called maybouya who had to be placated for an individual to avoid harm the chief function of their shamans called buyeis was to heal the sick with herbs and to cast spells piai which would keep maybouya at bay the buyeis were very important and underwent special training instead of becoming warriors as they were held to be the only people who could avert evil they were treated with great respect their ceremonies were accompanied with sacrifices as with the arawaks and other native americans the caribs smoked tobacco in the rituals of their religion social organization edit early carib culture was patriarchal women carried out the domestic duties of rearing young children processing and producing food and clothing and cultivating the land for farming including sowing and harvesting men carried out the tasks of hunting for food

among other south american tribes citation needed the women were highly revered and held substantial socio-political power 13 island carib society was reputedly more socially egalitarian than taíno society although there were village chiefs and war leaders there were no large states or multi-tiered aristocracy the local self-government unit may have been the longhouse dwellings populated by men or women typically run by one or more chieftains reporting to an island council food edit the caribs ate almost the same foods as the tainos they did not farm very well so they relied less on maize and cassava but still knew how to grow them although they were not very good farmers the caribs were excellent fishermen and were not afraid of long voyages their diet consisted of lots of protein they ate manatees ducks iguanas and fish among other foods the caribs had many myths and beliefs about diet they believed that eating pig would give one small beady eyes they also believed eating turtle meat made one stupid 14 in doing so they deprived themselves of the protein that was easily available in the west indies they also believed that eating crab before a voyage would bring storms the caribs seasoned their food with pepper but did not use salt couii and taumalin were pepper sauces taumalin was made from pepper lemon juice and the green meat of crab the caribs made ouicou a cassava beer with a strong alcoholic content and got very drunk on festivals and holidays although their diet was not quite so varied as that of the arawaks it was well balanced prepared in many different ways and served with different seasonings 14 music edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may

evolved form of traditional music still usually played using traditional instruments punta has seen some modernization and electrification in the 1970s this is called punta rock traditional punta dancing is consciously competitive artists like pen cayetano helped innovate modern punta rock by adding guitars to the traditional music and paved the way for later artists like andy palacio children of the most high and black coral punta was popular across the region especially in belize by the mid-1980s culminating in the release of punta rockers in 1987 a compilation featuring many of the genre

artist george s stuart the island carib word karibna meant person it became the origin of the english cannibal 15 although among the caribs it was apparently associated with rituals related to the eating of war enemies some europeans believed the caribs practised general cannibalism however these claims prove to be unsubstantiated and there is no evidence suggesting that native caribbean people practiced any form of cannibalism claims of the practice were based on european misconceptions historical anthropologist nicola foote asserts that there is no firm evidence that cannibalism ever existed 16 the caribs had a tradition of keeping bones of their ancestors in their houses missionaries such as père jean baptiste labat and cesar de rochefort described the practice as part of a belief that the ancestral spirits would always look after the bones and protect their descendants the caribs have been described as vicious and violent people in the history of the people who battled against other tribes italian explorer giovanni da verrazzano was killed and said to have been eaten by carib natives on what is now guadeloupe french west indies in 1528 before called karukera by the amerindian people which means “the island of beautiful waters” during his third voyage to north america after exploring florida the bahamas and the lesser antilles historian william riviere 17 has described the cannibalism as related to war rituals columbus and his people did not understand what they were seeing and they were shocked at this cannibalism in 1503 queen isabella ruled that only people who were better off under slavery a definition which explicitly included cannibals could legally be taken as slaves this provided spaniards an incentive and legalistic pretext for identifying various amerindian groups as cannibals to enslave them and take their lands away to this day the carib people fight against what they regard as a misconception about their ancestors the film pirates of the caribbean dead man s chest was criticised by the national garifuna council for portraying the carib people as cannibals in myths and realities of caribbean history the author basil a reid concluded that no evidence either archaeological or from firsthand observations by europeans conclusively proves that island caribs ever consumed human flesh 18 kalinago canoe project edit in 1997 dominica artist jacob frederick and tortola artist aragorn dick read joined forces and set out to build a traditional canoe based on the fishing canoes still used in dominica guadeloupe and martinique

reestablished with the remaining communities along the island chain a documentary the quest of the carib canoe was made by the bbc 19 the expedition sent shock waves through the lesser antilles as it made the local governments aware of the presence and the struggles for cultural survival of the kalinago

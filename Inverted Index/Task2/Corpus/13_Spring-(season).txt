various technical definitions of spring but local usage of the term varies according to local climate cultures and customs when it is spring in the northern hemisphere it will be autumn in the southern hemisphere and vice versa at the spring equinox days are approximately 12 hours long with day length increasing as the season progresses spring and springtime refer to the season and also to ideas of rebirth rejuvenation renewal resurrection and regrowth subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in terms of other seasons e.g dry or wet monsoonal or cyclonic often cultures have locally defined names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in europe spring is the time when many plants begin to grow and flower meteorological reckoning edit meteorologists generally define four seasons in many climatic areas spring summer autumn fall and winter these are demarcated by the values of their average temperatures on a monthly basis with each season lasting three months the three warmest months are by definition summer the three coldest months are winter and the intervening gaps are spring and autumn spring when defined in this manner can start on different dates in different regions in most northern hemisphere temperate locations spring months are march april and may although differences exist from country to country 1 summer is june july august autumn is september october november winter is december january february most southern hemisphere temperate locations have opposing seasons with spring in september october and november swedish meteorologists define the beginning of spring as the first occasion on which the average daytime temperature exceeds zero degrees celsius for seven consecutive days thus the date varies with latitude and elevation 2 in australia and new zealand spring conventionally begins on 1 september and ends 30 november 3 astronomical and solar reckoning edit in some cultures in the northern hemisphere e.g germany the astronomical vernal equinox varying between 19 and 21 march is taken to mark the first day of spring and the summer solstice around 21 june is taken as the first day of summer in persian culture the first day of spring is the first day of the first month called farvardin which begins on 20 or 21 march in other traditions the equinox is taken as mid-spring in the traditional chinese calendar the spring season 春 consists of the end of winter from 4 february and beginning of spring to 5 may roughly taking the equinox as its midpoint similarly according to the celtic tradition which is based solely on daylight and the strength of the noon sun spring begins in early february near imbolc or candlemas and continues until early may beltane other calendar-based reckoning edit in ireland spring traditionally starts on february 1 st brigid s day 4 although irish meteorologists consider the whole of february to be part of winter 5 6 ecological reckoning edit the beginning of spring is not always determined by fixed calendar dates the phenological or ecological definition of spring relates to biological indicators such as the blossoming of a range of plant species the activities of animals and the special smell of soil that has reached the temperature for micro flora to flourish these indicators along with the beginning of spring vary according to the local climate and according to the specific weather of a particular year most ecologists divide the year into six seasons that have no fixed dates in addition to spring ecological reckoning identifies an earlier separate prevernal early or pre-spring season between the hibernal winter and vernal spring seasons this is a time when only the hardiest flowers like the crocus are in bloom sometimes while there is still some snowcover on the ground 7 natural events edit hundreds of sour cherry blooming in extremadura spain during spring a blooming field of garland chrysanthemum a typical spring flower in israel a willow in stockholm in april 2016 during early spring the axis of the earth is increasing its tilt relative to the sun and the length of daylight rapidly increases for the relevant hemisphere the hemisphere begins to warm significantly causing new plant growth to spring forth giving the season its name citation needed any snow begins to melt swelling streams with runoff and any frosts become less severe in climates that have no snow and rare frosts air and ground temperatures increase more rapidly many flowering plants bloom at this time of year in a long succession sometimes beginning when snow is still on the ground and continuing into early summer citation needed in normally snowless areas spring may begin as early as february northern hemisphere heralded by the blooming of deciduous magnolias cherries and quince or august southern hemisphere in the same way citation needed many temperate areas have a dry spring and wet autumn fall which brings about flowering in this season more consistent with the need for water as well as warmth subarctic areas may not experience spring at all until may while spring is a result of the warmth caused by the changing orientation of the earth s axis relative to the sun the weather in many parts of the world is affected by other less predictable events the rainfall in spring or any season follows trends more related to longer cycles—such as the solar cycle—or events created by ocean currents and ocean temperatures—for example the el niño effect and the southern oscillation index unstable spring weather may occur more often when warm air begins to invade from lower latitudes while cold air is still pushing from the polar regions flooding is also most common in and near mountainous areas during this time of year because of snow-melt which is accelerated by warm rains in north america tornado alley is most active at this time of year especially since the rocky mountains prevent the surging hot and cold air masses from spreading eastward and instead force them into direct conflict besides tornadoes supercell thunderstorms can also produce dangerously large hail and very high winds for which a severe thunderstorm warning or tornado warning is usually issued even more so than in winter the jet streams play an important role in unstable and severe northern hemisphere weather in springtime citation needed in recent decades season creep has been observed which means that many phenological signs of spring are occurring earlier in many regions by around two days per decade spring in the southern hemisphere is different in several significant ways to that of the northern hemisphere for several reasons including there is no land bridge between southern hemisphere countries and the antarctic zone capable of bringing in cold air without the temperature-mitigating effects of extensive tracts of water the vastly greater amount of ocean in the southern hemisphere at all latitudes at this time in earth s geologic history the earth has an orbit which brings it in closer to the southern hemisphere for its warmer seasons there is a circumpolar flow of air the roaring 40s and 50s uninterrupted by large land masses no equivalent jet streams and the peculiarities of the reversing ocean currents in the pacific citation needed cultural events edit albania edit

stream the humidity of bermuda s oceanic climate ensures its winters and summers are mild respectively neither as cold nor as warm as experienced in continental areas such as new york but also means that temperatures are slow to change other than through the blasts of arctic air behind the cold fronts that sweep across from north america most forcefully during the winter at intervals of several days this means that cool wet and blustery weather is typical in bermuda late in spring when temperatures in the north-east of the united states have already begun spiking to levels bermuda will not see until mid-summer this is not always apparent from comparing average high temperatures as bermuda s humid climate also moderates temperature change during the course of a day with only a 10 degree fahrenheit difference between daily high and low temperatures by comparison the average high and low temperatures for the 1st of may in new york city are 67° and 50° and on the 31st of may are 75° and

global warming wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this page is about the current warming of the earth s climate system climate change can also refer to climate trends at any point in earth s history for other uses see global warming disambiguation global mean surface-temperature change from 1880 to 2016 relative to the 1951–1980 mean the black line is the global annual mean and the red line is the five-year local regression line the blue uncertainty bars show a 95 confidence interval global warming also referred to as climate change is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the earth s climate system and its related effects 1 2 multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming 3 4 5 many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid-19th century and in paleoclimate proxy records covering thousands of years 6 in 2013 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report concluded that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century 7 the largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 °c 0.5 to 3.1 °f in the lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to 4.8 °c 4.7 to 8.6 °f in the highest emissions scenario 8 these findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations 9 a and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing 11 12 future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe 13 14 anticipated effects include increasing global temperatures rising sea levels changing precipitation and expansion of deserts in the subtropics 15 warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the arctic with the continuing retreat of glaciers permafrost and sea ice other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves droughts heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall 16 ocean acidification and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels 17 18 because the climate system has a large inertia and greenhouse gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time many of these effects will persist for not only decades or centuries but for tens of thousands of years to come 19 possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction adaptation to its effects building systems resilient to its effects and possible future climate engineering most countries are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc 20 whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change 21 parties to the unfccc have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required 22 and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 °c 3.6 °f compared to pre-industrial levels b with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 °c 2.7 °f 24 public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing a global 2015 pew research center report showed that a median of 54 of all respondents asked consider it a very serious problem significant regional differences exist with americans and chinese whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual co2 emissions among the least concerned 25 observed temperature changes main article instrumental temperature record world map showing surface temperature trends °c per decade between

overlaid in black noaa graph of global annual temperature anomalies 1950–2012 showing the el niño southern oscillation in the period from 1880 to 2012 the global average land and ocean surface temperature has increased by 0.85 0.65 to 1.06 °c multiple independently produced datasets confirm 27 in the period from 1906 to 2005 earth s average surface temperature rose by

although the popular press often reports the increase of the average near-surface atmospheric temperature as the measure of global warming most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans the rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and the atmosphere 29 c since 1979 the average temperature of the lower troposphere has increased between 0.12 and 0.135 °c 0.216 and 0.243 °f  per decade satellite temperature measurements confirm 30 31 climate proxies show the temperature to have been relatively stable over the one or two thousand years before 1850 with regionally varying fluctuations such as the medieval warm period and the little ice age 32 the warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations as documented by many independent scientific groups 33 examples include sea level rise 34 widespread melting of snow and land ice 35 increased heat content of the oceans 33 increased humidity 33 and the earlier timing of spring events 36 e.g. the flowering of plants 37 the probability that these changes could have occurred by chance is virtually zero 33 regional trends and short-term fluctuations play media temperature anomalies arranged by country 1900–2016 deviation from the 1951–1980 mean temperature visualization based on gistemp data temperature increases vary a lot across the globe since 1979 land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as ocean temperatures 7002273399999999999♠0.25 °c per decade against 7002273279999999999♠0.13 °c per decade 38 ocean temperatures increase more slowly than land temperatures because of the larger effective heat capacity of the oceans and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation 39 since the beginning of industrialisation in the eighteenth century the temperature difference between the hemispheres has increased due to melting of sea ice and snow in the north 40 in the past one hundred years average arctic temperatures have been increasing at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world however arctic temperatures are also highly variable 41 although more greenhouse gases are emitted in the northern than in the southern hemisphere this fact does not contribute to the difference in warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to diffuse within as well as between the hemispheres 42 the thermal inertia of the oceans and the slow responses of other indirect effects occasion the climate to take centuries or longer to adjust to past changes in forcings one climate commitment study concluded that if greenhouse gases were stabilized at year 2000 levels surface temperatures would still increase by about one-half degree celsius 43 and another found that if they were stabilized at 2005 levels surface warming could exceed a whole degree celsius some of this surface warming will be driven by past natural forcings which are still seeking equilibrium in the climate system one study using a highly simplified climate model indicates these past natural forcings may account for as much as 64 of the committed 2050 surface warming and their influence will fade with time compared to the human contribution 44 global temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlay long-term trends and can temporarily mask them the relative stability in surface temperature from 2002 to 2009 which has since been dubbed the global warming hiatus by the media and some scientists 45 is an example of such an episode 46 47 2015 updates to account for differing methods of measuring ocean surface temperature measurements show a positive trend over the recent decade 48 49 warmest years vs overall trend sixteen of the seventeen warmest years on record have occurred since 2000 50 while record-breaking years attract considerable public interest individual years are less significant than the overall trend some climatologists have criticized the attention that the popular press gives to warmest year statistics in particular ocean oscillations such as the el niño southern oscillation enso can cause temperatures of a given year to be abnormally warm or cold for reasons unrelated to the overall trend of climate change gavin schmidt stated the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are far more important than whether any single year is a record or not 51 initial causes of temperature changes external forcings co2 concentrations over the last 400,000 years greenhouse effect schematic showing energy flows between space the atmosphere and earth s surface energy exchanges are expressed in watts per square metre w m2 main article attribution of recent climate change by itself the climate system may generate random changes in global temperatures for years to decades at a time but long-term changes emanate only from so-called external forcings 52 53 54 these forcings are external to the climate system but not necessarily external to earth 55 examples of external forcings include changes in the composition of the atmosphere e.g. increased concentrations of greenhouse gases solar luminosity volcanic eruptions and variations in earth s orbit around the sun 56 greenhouse gases main articles greenhouse gas greenhouse effect radiative forcing carbon dioxide in earth s atmosphere and earth s energy budget see also list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions and history of climate change science the greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in a planet s atmosphere warm its lower atmosphere and surface it was proposed by joseph fourier in 1824 discovered in 1860 by john tyndall 57 was first investigated quantitatively by svante arrhenius in 1896 58 and its scientific description was developed in the 1930s through 1960s by guy stewart callendar 59 60 annual world greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 by sector percentage share of global cumulative energy-related co2 emissions between 1751 and 2012 across different regions on earth an atmosphere containing naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases causes air temperature near the surface to be about 33 °c 59 °f warmer than it would be in their absence 61 d without the earth s atmosphere the earth s average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of water 62 the major greenhouse gases are water vapour which causes about 36–70 of the greenhouse effect carbon dioxide co2 which causes 9–26 methane ch4 which causes 4–9 and ozone o3 which causes 3–7 63 64 65 clouds also affect the radiation balance through cloud forcings similar to greenhouse gases human activity since the industrial revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to increased radiative forcing from co2 methane tropospheric ozone cfcs and nitrous oxide according to work published in 2007 the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by 36 and 148 respectively since 1750 66 these levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores 67 68 69 70 less direct geological evidence indicates that co2 values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago 71 fossil fuel burning has produced about three-quarters of the increase in co2 from human activity over the past 20 years the rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use particularly deforestation 72 another significant non-fuel source of anthropogenic co2 emissions is the calcination of limestone for clinker production a chemical process which releases co2 73 estimates of global co2 emissions in 2011 from fossil fuel combustion including cement production and gas flaring was 34.8 billion tonnes 9.5 ± 0.5 pgc an increase of 54 above emissions in 1990 coal burning was responsible for 43 of the total emissions oil 34 gas 18 cement 4.9 and gas flaring 0.7 74 in may 2013 it was reported that readings for co2 taken at the world s primary benchmark site in mauna loa surpassed 400 ppm according to professor brian hoskins this is likely the first time co2 levels have been this high for about 4.5 million years 75 76 monthly global co2 concentrations exceeded 400 ppm in march 2015 probably for the first time in several million years 77 on 12 november 2015 nasa scientists reported that human-made carbon dioxide continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere 78 global carbon dioxide emissions by country over the last three decades of the twentieth century gross domestic product per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions 79 co2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change 80 81 71 emissions can be attributed to different regions attributions of emissions due to land-use change are subject to considerable uncertainty 82 83 289 emissions scenarios estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic sociological technological and natural developments 84 in most scenarios emissions continue to rise over the century while in a few emissions are reduced 85 86 fossil fuel reserves are abundant and will not limit carbon emissions in the 21st century 87 emission scenarios combined with modelling of the carbon cycle have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future using the six ipcc sres marker scenarios models suggest that by the year 2100 the atmospheric concentration of co2 could range between 541 and 970 ppm 88 this is 90–250 above the concentration in the year 1750 the popular media and the public often confuse global warming with ozone depletion i.e. the destruction of stratospheric ozone e.g. the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons 89 90 although there are a few areas of linkage the relationship between the two is not strong reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming effect 91 aerosols and soot ship tracks can be seen as lines in these clouds over the atlantic ocean on the east coast of the united states atmospheric particles from these and other sources could have a large effect on climate through the aerosol indirect effect global dimming a gradual reduction in the amount of global direct irradiance at the earth s surface was observed from 1961 until at least 1990 92 solid and liquid particles known as aerosols produced by volcanoes and human-made pollutants are thought to be the main cause of this dimming they exert a cooling effect by increasing the reflection of incoming sunlight the effects of the products of fossil fuel combustion – co2 and aerosols – have partially offset one another in recent decades so that net warming has been due to the increase in non-co2 greenhouse gases such as methane 93 radiative forcing due to aerosols is temporally limited due to the processes that remove aerosols from the atmosphere removal by clouds and precipitation gives tropospheric aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week while stratospheric aerosols can remain for a few years carbon dioxide has a lifetime of a century or more and as such changes in aerosols will only delay climate changes due to carbon dioxide 94 black carbon is second only to carbon dioxide for its contribution to global warming contribution being estimated at 17 to 20 whereas carbon dioxide contributes 40 to 45 to global warming 95 96 97 in addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation aerosols have indirect effects on the earth s radiation budget sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets a phenomenon known as the twomey effect 98 this effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight known as the albrecht effect 99 indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing 100 soot may either cool or warm earth s climate system depending on whether it is airborne or deposited atmospheric soot directly absorbs solar radiation which heats the atmosphere and cools the surface in isolated areas with high soot production such as rural india as much as 50 of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by atmospheric brown clouds 101 when deposited especially on glaciers or on ice in arctic regions the lower surface albedo can also directly heat the surface 102 the influences of atmospheric particles including black carbon are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics particularly in asia while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern hemisphere 103 changes in total solar irradiance tsi and monthly sunspot numbers since the mid-1970s contribution of natural factors and human activities to radiative forcing of climate change 104 radiative forcing values are for the year 2005 relative to the pre-industrial era 1750 104 the contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing is 5 the value of the combined radiative forcing due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide 105 solar activity main article solar activity and climate since 1978 solar irradiance has been measured by satellites 106 these measurements indicate that the sun s radiative output has not increased since then so the warming that occurred in the past 40 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the earth climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change 107 models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when only taking into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity models are however able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings consisting of both human influences and natural forcings another line of evidence for the sun s non-attributability is the differing temperature changes at different levels in the earth s atmosphere 108 according to basic physical principles the greenhouse effect produces warming of the lower atmosphere the troposphere but cooling of the upper atmosphere the stratosphere 109 110 if solar variations were responsible for the observed warming warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected 111 variations in earth s orbit main article milankovitch cycles the tilt of the earth’s axis and the shape of its orbit around the sun vary slowly over tens of thousands of years this changes climate by changing the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar energy at earth s surface 112 during the last few thousand years this phenomenon contributed to a slow cooling trend at high latitudes of the northern hemisphere during summer a trend that was reversed by greenhouse-gas-induced warming during the 20th century 113 114 115 116 orbital cycles favorable for glaciation are not expected within the next 50,000 years 117 118 feedback main articles climate change feedback and climate sensitivity sea ice shown here in nunavut in northern canada reflects more sunshine while open ocean absorbs more accelerating melting the climate system includes a range of feedbacks which alter the response of the system to changes in external forcings positive feedbacks increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing while negative feedbacks reduce it 119 there are a range of feedbacks in the climate system including water vapour changes in ice-albedo snow and ice cover affect how much the earth s surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight clouds and changes in the earth s carbon cycle e.g. the release of carbon from soil 120 the main negative feedback is the energy the earth s surface radiates into space as infrared radiation 121 according to the stefan-boltzmann law if the absolute temperature as measured in kelvins doubles e radiated energy increases by a factor of 16 2 to the 4th power 122 feedbacks are an important factor in determining the sensitivity of the climate system to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations other factors being equal a higher climate sensitivity means that more warming will occur for a given increase in greenhouse gas forcing 123 uncertainty over the effect of feedbacks is a major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario more research is needed to understand the role of clouds 119 and carbon cycle feedbacks in climate projections 124 the ipcc projections previously mentioned span the likely range greater than 66 probability based on expert judgement 125 for the selected emissions scenarios however the ipcc s projections do not reflect the full range of uncertainty 126 the lower end of the likely range appears to be better constrained than the upper end 126 climate models calculations of global warming prepared in or before 2001 from a range of climate models under the sres a2 emissions scenario which assumes no action is taken to reduce emissions and regionally divided economic development projected change in annual mean surface air temperature from the late 20th century to the middle 21st century based on a medium emissions scenario sres a1b 127 this scenario assumes that no future policies are adopted to limit greenhouse gas emissions image credit noaa gfdl 128 main article global climate model a climate model is a representation of the physical chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system 129 such models are based on scientific disciplines such as fluid dynamics and thermodynamics as well as physical processes such as radiative transfer the models may be used to predict a range of variables such as local air movement temperature clouds and other atmospheric properties ocean temperature salt content and circulation ice cover on land and sea the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere and chemical and biological processes among others although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model s climate sensitivity for example the uncertainty in ipcc s 2007 projections is caused by 1 the use of multiple models 126 with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations 130 2 the use of differing estimates of humanity s future greenhouse gas emissions 126 3 any additional emissions from climate feedbacks that were not included in the models ipcc used to prepare its report i.e. greenhouse gas releases from permafrost 131 the models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes warming or cooling is thus a result not an assumption of the models 132 clouds and their effects are especially difficult to predict improving the models representation of clouds is therefore an important topic in current research 133 another prominent research topic is expanding and improving representations of the carbon cycle 134 135 136 models are also used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human causes although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 56 the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates 137 climate models produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century but do not simulate all aspects of climate 138 not all effects of global warming are accurately predicted by the climate models used by the ipcc observed arctic shrinkage has been faster than that predicted 139 precipitation increased proportionally to atmospheric humidity and hence significantly faster than global climate models predict 140 141 since 1990 sea level has also risen considerably faster than models predicted it would 142 observed and expected environmental effects main article effects of global warming projections of global mean sea level rise by parris and others 143 probabilities have not been assigned to these projections 144 therefore none of these projections should be interpreted as a best estimate of future sea level rise image credit noaa anthropogenic forcing has likely contributed to some of the observed changes including sea level rise changes in climate extremes such as the number of warm and cold days declines in arctic sea ice extent glacier retreat and greening of the sahara 145 146 during the 21st century glaciers 147 and snow cover 148 are projected to continue their widespread retreat projections of declines in arctic sea ice vary 149 150 recent projections suggest that arctic summers could be ice-free defined as ice extent less than 1 million square km as early as 2025–2030 151 detection is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined statistical sense without providing a reason for that change detection does not imply attribution of the detected change to a particular cause attribution of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence 152 detection and attribution may also be applied to observed changes in physical ecological and social systems 153 extreme weather main articles extreme weather and physical impacts of climate change § extreme events changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land with most warming at high northern latitudes and least warming over the southern ocean and parts of the north atlantic ocean 154 future changes in precipitation are expected to follow existing trends with reduced precipitation over subtropical land areas and increased precipitation at subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions 155 projections suggest a probable increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events such as heat waves 156 a 2015 study published in nature climate change states about 18 of the moderate daily precipitation extremes over land are attributable to the observed temperature increase since pre-industrial times which in turn primarily results from human influence for 2 °c of warming the fraction of precipitation extremes attributable to human influence rises to about 40 likewise today about 75 of the moderate daily hot extremes over land are attributable to warming it is the most rare and extreme events for which the largest fraction is anthropogenic and that contribution increases nonlinearly with further warming 157 158 data analysis of extreme events from 1960 until 2010 suggests that droughts and heat waves appear simultaneously with increased frequency 159 extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased since 1980 160 sea level rise map of the earth with a six-metre sea level rise represented in red main articles sea level rise and retreat of glaciers since 1850 sparse records indicate that glaciers have been retreating since the early 1800s in the 1950s measurements began that allow the monitoring of glacial mass balance reported to the world glacier monitoring service wgms and the national snow and ice data center nsidc the sea level rise since 1993 has been estimated to have been on average 2.6 mm and 2.9 mm per year ± 0.4 mm additionally sea level rise has accelerated from 1995 to 2015 161 over the 21st century the ipcc projects for a high emissions scenario that global mean sea level could rise by 52–98 cm 162 the ipcc s projections are conservative and may underestimate future sea level rise 163 other estimates suggest that for the same period global mean sea level could rise by 0.2 to 2.0 m 0.7–6.6 ft relative to mean sea level in 1992 143 widespread coastal flooding would be expected if several degrees of warming is sustained for millennia 164 for example sustained global warming of more than 2 °c relative to pre-industrial levels could lead to eventual sea level rise of around 1 to 4 m due to thermal expansion of sea water and the melting of glaciers and small ice caps 164 melting of the greenland ice sheet could contribute an additional 4 to 7.5 m over many thousands of years 164 it has been estimated that we are already committed to a sea-level rise of approximately 2.3 metres for each degree of temperature rise within the next 2,000 years 165 warming beyond the 2 °c target would potentially lead to rates of sea-level rise dominated by ice loss from antarctica continued co2 emissions from fossil sources could cause additional tens of metres of sea level rise over the next millennia and eventually ultimately eliminate the entire antarctic ice sheet causing about 58 metres of sea level rise 166 ecological systems main article climate change and ecosystems in terrestrial ecosystems the earlier timing of spring events as well as poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges have been linked with high confidence to recent warming 167 future climate change is expected to affect particular ecosystems including tundra mangroves coral reefs 154 and caves 168 it is expected that most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric co2 levels combined with higher global temperatures 169 overall it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems 170 increases in atmospheric co2 concentrations have led to an increase in ocean acidity 171 dissolved co2 increases ocean acidity measured by lower ph values 171 between 1750 and 2000 surface-ocean ph has decreased by ≈0.1 from ≈8.2 to ≈8.1 172 surface-ocean ph has probably not been below ≈8.1 during the past 2 million years 172 projections suggest that surface-ocean ph could decrease by an additional 0.3–0.4 units by 2100 173 future ocean acidification could threaten coral reefs fisheries protected species and other natural resources of value to society 171 174 ocean deoxygenation is projected to increase hypoxia by 10 and triple suboxic waters oxygen concentrations 98 less than the mean surface concentrations for each 1 °c of upper ocean warming 175 long-term effects main article long-term effects of global warming on the timescale of centuries to millennia the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co2 emissions 176 this is due to carbon dioxide s very long lifetime in the atmosphere 176 stabilizing the global average temperature would require large reductions in co2 emissions 176 as well as reductions in emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide 176 177 emissions of co2 would need to be reduced by more than 80 relative to their peak level 176 even if this were achieved global average temperatures would remain close to their highest level for many centuries 176 as of 2016 emissions of co2 from burning fossil fuels had stopped increasing but the guardian reports they need to be reduced to have a real impact on climate change meanwhile this greenhouse gas continues to accumulate in the atmosphere 178 in that context the new york times reported that scientific installations analyzing oceanic air detected the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose at the highest rate on record in 2015 and 2016 179 it hs been suggested that this rise in co2 levels is the result of changing absorption patterns of the ocean and land surface in that they may have reached the limit of their ability to absorb carbon dioxide 179 also co2 is not the only factor driving climate change concentrations of atmospheric methane another greenhouse gas rose dramatically between 2006–2016 for unknown reasons this undermines efforts to combat global warming and there is a risk of an uncontrollable runaway greenhouse effect 180 long-term effects also include a response from the earth s crust due to ice melting and deglaciation in a process called post-glacial rebound when land masses are no longer depressed by the weight of ice this could lead to landslides and increased seismic and volcanic activities tsunamis could be generated by submarine landslides caused by warmer ocean water thawing ocean-floor permafrost or releasing gas hydrates 181 some world regions such as the french alps already show signs of an increase in landslide frequency 182 large-scale and abrupt impacts main article abrupt climate change see also cold blob north atlantic climate change could result in global large-scale changes in natural and social systems 183 examples include the possibility for the atlantic meridional overturning circulation to slow or shutdown which in the instance of a shutdown would change weather in europe and north america considerably ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and the long-term melting of ice sheets which contributes to sea level rise 184 some large-scale changes could occur abruptly i.e. over a short time period and might also be irreversible examples of abrupt climate change are the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost which would lead to amplified global warming or the shutdown of thermohaline circulation 185 186 scientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally poor 187 the probability of abrupt change for some climate related feedbacks may be low 185 188 factors that may increase the probability of abrupt climate change include higher magnitudes of global warming warming that occurs more rapidly and warming that is sustained over longer time periods 188 observed and expected effects on social systems further information effects of global warming § social systems and regional effects of global warming § regional impacts see also climate change and national security the effects of climate change on human systems mostly due to warming or shifts in precipitation patterns or both have been detected worldwide production of wheat and maize globally has been impacted by climate change while crop production has increased in some mid-latitude regions such as the uk and northeast china economic losses due to extreme weather events have increased globally there has been a shift from cold to heat-related mortality in some regions as a result of warming livelihoods of indigenous peoples of the arctic have been altered by climate change and there is emerging evidence of climate change impacts on livelihoods of indigenous peoples in other regions regional impacts of climate change are now observable at more locations than before on all continents and across ocean regions 189 the future social impacts of climate change will be uneven 190 many risks are expected to increase with higher magnitudes of global warming 191 all regions are at risk of experiencing negative impacts 192 low-latitude less developed areas face the greatest risk 193 a study from 2015 concluded that economic growth gross domestic product of poorer countries is much more impaired with projected future climate warming than previously thought 194 a meta-analysis of 56 studies concluded in 2014 that each degree of temperature rise will increase violence by up to 20 which includes fist fights violent crimes civil unrest or wars 195 examples of impacts include food crop production will probably be negatively affected in low latitude countries while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative 196 global warming of around 4.6 °c relative to pre-industrial levels could pose a large risk to global and regional food security 197 health generally impacts will be more negative than positive 198 199 200 impacts include the effects of extreme weather leading to injury and loss of life 201 and indirect effects such as undernutrition

inundation as a result of sea level rise is expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements 203 204 this could lead to issues of homelessness in countries with low-lying areas such as bangladesh as well as statelessness for populations in countries such as the maldives and tuvalu 205 economy see also economics of global warming estimates based on the ipcc a1b emission scenario from additional co2 and ch4 greenhouse gases released from permafrost estimate associated impact damages by us 43 trillion 206 infrastructure continued permafrost degradation will likely result in unstable infrastructure in arctic regions or alaska before 2100 thus impacting roads pipelines and buildings as well as water distribution and cause slope failures 207 possible responses to global warming mitigation main article climate change mitigation the graph on the right shows three pathways to meet the unfccc s 2 °c target labelled global technology decentralized solutions and consumption change each pathway shows how various measures e.g. improved energy efficiency increased use of renewable energy could contribute to emissions reductions image credit pbl netherlands environmental assessment agency 208 mitigation of climate change are actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb ghgs from the atmosphere 209 there is a large potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of activities including energy conservation and increased energy efficiency the use of low-carbon energy technologies such as renewable energy nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage 210 211 and enhancing carbon sinks through for example reforestation and preventing deforestation 210 211 a 2015 report by citibank concluded that transitioning to a low carbon economy would yield positive return on investments 212 near and long-term trends in the global energy system are inconsistent with limiting global warming at below 1.5 or 2 °c relative to pre-industrial levels 213 214 pledges made as part of the cancún agreements are broadly consistent with having a likely chance 66 to 100 probability of limiting global warming in the 21st century at below 3 °c relative to pre-industrial levels 214 in limiting warming at below 2 °c more stringent emission reductions in the near-term would allow for less rapid reductions after 2030 215 many integrated models are unable to meet the 2 °c target if pessimistic assumptions are made about the availability of mitigation technologies 216 adaptation main article adaptation to global warming other policy responses include adaptation to climate change adaptation to climate change may be planned either in reaction to or anticipation of climate change or spontaneous i.e. without government intervention 217 planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis 210 the barriers limits and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood 210 a concept related to adaptation is adaptive capacity which is the ability of a system human natural or managed to adjust to climate change including climate variability and extremes to moderate potential damages to take advantage of opportunities or to cope with consequences 218 unmitigated climate change i.e. future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions would in the long term be likely to exceed the capacity of natural managed and human systems to adapt 219 environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions 220 climate engineering main article climate engineering climate engineering sometimes called geoengineering or climate intervention is the deliberate modification of the climate it has been investigated as a possible response to global warming e.g by nasa 221 and the royal society 222 techniques under research fall generally into the categories solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal although various other schemes have been suggested a study from 2014 investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change 223 discourse about global warming political discussion main article politics of global warming further information 2011 2012 2013 and 2015 sessions of united nations climate change conference article 2 of the un framework convention refers explicitly to stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations 224 to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of co 2 emissions worldwide would need to be dramatically reduced from their present level 225 most countries in the world are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc 226 the ultimate objective of the convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system 227 as stated in the convention this requires that ghg concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change food production is not threatened and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion 228 the framework convention was agreed on in 1992 but global emissions have risen since then 229 during negotiations the g77 a lobbying group in the united nations representing 133 developing nations 230 4 pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to take the lead in reducing their emissions 231 this was justified on the basis that the developed world s emissions had contributed most to the cumulation of ghgs in the atmosphere per-capita emissions i.e. emissions per head of population were still relatively low in developing countries and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs 83 290 this mandate was sustained in the kyoto protocol to the framework convention 83 290 which entered into legal effect in 2005 232 in ratifying the kyoto protocol most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions these first-round commitments expired in 2012 232 united states president george w bush rejected the treaty on the basis that it exempts 80 of the world including major population centres such as china and india from compliance and would cause serious harm to the us economy 230 5 at the 15th unfccc conference of the parties held in 2009 at copenhagen several unfccc parties produced the copenhagen accord 233 234 parties associated with the accord 140 countries as of november 2010 235 9 aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below 7002275149999999999♠2 °c 236 the 16th conference of the parties cop16 was held at cancún in 2010 it produced an agreement not a binding treaty that the parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to 7002275149999999999♠2 °c above pre-industrial temperatures it also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of 7002274649999999999♠1.5 °c 237 scientific discussion see also scientific opinion on climate change and surveys of scientists views on climate change the discussion continues in scientific articles that are peer-reviewed and assessed by scientists who work in the relevant fields and participate in the intergovernmental panel on climate change the scientific consensus as of 2013 stated in the ipcc fifth assessment report is that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century 238 a 2008 report by the u.s national academy of sciences stated that most scientists by then agreed that observed warming in recent decades was primarily caused by human activities increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 80 in 2005 the royal society stated that while the overwhelming majority of scientists were in agreement on the main points some individuals and organizations opposed to the consensus on urgent action needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions had tried to undermine the science and work of the ipcc 239 national science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions 240 in the scientific literature there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases 241 no scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view 242 243 discussion by the public and in popular media main articles climate change denial global warming controversy and media coverage of climate change global warming was the cover story in this 2007 issue of ms magazine the global warming controversy refers to a variety of disputes substantially more pronounced in the popular media than in the scientific literature 244 245 regarding the nature causes and consequences of global warming the disputed issues include the causes of increased global average air temperature especially since the mid-20th century whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations whether humankind has contributed significantly to it and whether the increase is completely or partially an artefact of poor measurements additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity predictions of additional warming and what the consequences of global warming will be by 1990 american conservative think tanks had begun challenging the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem they challenged the scientific evidence argued that global warming would have benefits and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good 246 some people dispute aspects of climate change science 239 247 organizations such as the libertarian competitive enterprise institute conservative commentators and some companies such as exxonmobil have challenged ipcc climate change scenarios funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls 248 249 250 251 on the other hand some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years 252 or even called for policies to reduce global warming 253 global oil companies have begun to acknowledge climate change exists and is caused by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels 254 surveys of public opinion main article public opinion on climate change the global warming problem came to international public attention in the late 1980s polling groups began to track opinions on the subject at first mainly in the united states 255 the longest consistent polling by gallup in the us found relatively small deviations of 10 or so from 1998 to 2015 in opinion on the seriousness of global warming but with increasing polarization between those concerned and those unconcerned 256 the first major worldwide poll conducted by gallup in 2008–2009 in 127 countries found that some 62 of people worldwide said they knew about global warming in the advanced countries of north america europe and japan 90 or more knew about it 97 in the u.s. 99 in japan in less developed countries especially in africa fewer than a quarter knew about it although many had noticed local weather changes among those who knew about global warming there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities 257 by 2010 with 111 countries surveyed gallup determined that there had been a substantial decrease since 2007–2008 in the number of americans and europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat in the us just a little over half the population 53 viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families this was 10 points below the 2008 poll 63 latin america had the biggest rise in concern 73 said global warming was a serious threat to their families 258 this global poll also found that people were more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes except in the us where nearly half 47 of the population attributed global warming to natural causes 259 a march–may 2013 survey by pew research center for the people the press polled 39 countries about global threats according to 54 of those questioned global warming featured top of the perceived global threats 260 in a january 2013 survey pew found that 69 of americans say there is solid evidence that the earth s average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades up six points since november 2011 and 12 points since 2009 261 a 2010 survey of 14 industrialized countries found that skepticism about the danger of global warming was highest in australia norway new zealand and the united states in that order correlating positively with per capita emissions of carbon dioxide 262 etymology in the 1950s research suggested increasing temperatures and a 1952 newspaper reported climate change this phrase next appeared in a november 1957 report in the hammond times which described roger revelle s research into the effects of increasing human-caused co2 emissions on the greenhouse effect a large scale global warming with radical climate changes may result both phrases were only used occasionally until 1975 when wallace smith broecker published a scientific paper on the topic climatic change are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming the phrase began to come into common use and in 1976 mikhail budyko s statement that a global warming up has started was widely reported 263 other studies such as a 1971 mit report referred to the human impact as inadvertent climate modification but an influential 1979 national academy of sciences study headed by jule charney followed broecker in using global warming for rising surface temperatures while describing the wider effects of increased co2 as climate change 264 in 1986 and november 1987 nasa climate scientist james hansen gave testimony to congress on global warming there were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988 and when hansen testified in the senate on 23 june he sparked worldwide interest 265 he said global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming 266 public attention increased over the summer and global warming became the dominant popular term commonly used both by the press and in public discourse 264 in a 2008 nasa article on usage erik m conway defined global warming as the increase in earth’s average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases while climate change was a long-term change in the earth’s climate or of a region on earth as effects such as changing patterns of rainfall and rising sea levels would probably have more impact than temperatures alone he considered global climate change a more scientifically accurate term and like the intergovernmental panel on climate change the nasa website would emphasize this wider context 264

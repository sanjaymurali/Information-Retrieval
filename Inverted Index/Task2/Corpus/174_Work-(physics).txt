alembert clairaut lagrange laplace hamilton poisson daniel bernoulli johann bernoulli cauchy v t e in physics a force is said to do work if when acting there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force for example when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped the work done on the ball as it falls is equal to the weight of the ball a force multiplied by the distance to the ground a displacement work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another the term work was introduced in 1826 by the french mathematician gaspard-gustave coriolis 1 2 as weight lifted through a height which is based on the use of early steam engines to lift buckets of water out of flooded ore mines the si unit of work is the joule j units edit the si unit of work is the joule j which is defined as the work expended by a force of one newton through a displacement of one metre the dimensionally equivalent newton-metre n⋅m is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work but this can be confused with the unit newton-metre which is the measurement unit of torque usage of n⋅m is discouraged by the si authority since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement or a measurement of work 3 non-si units of work include the erg the foot-pound the foot-poundal the kilowatt hour the litre-atmosphere and the horsepower-hour due to work having the same physical dimension as heat occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content such as therm btu and calorie are utilized as a measuring unit work and energy edit the work w displaystyle w done by a constant force of magnitude f displaystyle f on a point that moves a displacement s displaystyle s in a straight line in the direction of the force is the product w f s displaystyle w fs for example if a force of 10 newtons f displaystyle f 10 n acts along a point that travels 2 meters s displaystyle s 2 m then it does the work w displaystyle w 10 n 2 m 20 n m 20 j this is approximately the work done lifting a 1 kg weight from ground level to over a person s head against the force of gravity notice that the work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distance work is closely related to energy the work-energy principle states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a rigid body is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body conversely a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant force from newton s second law it can be shown that work on a free no fields rigid no internal degrees of freedom body is equal to the change in kinetic energy k e displaystyle ke of the velocity and rotation of that body w Δ k e displaystyle w delta ke the work of forces generated by a potential function is known as potential energy and the forces are said to be conservative therefore work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force field without change in velocity or rotation is equal to minus the change of potential energy p e displaystyle pe of the object w − Δ p e displaystyle w delta pe these formulas show that work is the energy associated with the action of a force so work subsequently possesses the physical dimensions and units of energy the work energy principles discussed here are identical to electric work energy principles constraint forces edit constraint forces determine the movement of components in a system constraining the object within a boundary in the case of a slope plus gravity the object is stuck to the slope when attached to a taut string it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any tauter constraint forces ensure the velocity in the direction of the constraint is zero which means the constraint forces do not perform work on the system if the system doesn t change in time 4 they eliminate all movement in the direction of the constraint thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system as the velocity of that object is constrained to be 0 parallel to this force due to this force this only applies for a single particle system for example in an atwood machine the rope does work on each body but keeping always the net virtual work null there are however cases where this is not true 4 for example the centripetal force exerted inwards by a string on a ball in uniform circular motion sideways constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the center of the circle this force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball another example is a book on a table if external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards the force exerted by the table supports the book and is perpendicular to its movement which means that this constraint force does not perform work the magnetic force on a charged particle is f qv × b where q is the charge v is the velocity of the particle and b is the magnetic field the result of a cross product is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors so f ⊥ v the dot product of two perpendicular vectors is always zero so the work w f ⋅ v 0 and the magnetic force does not do work it can change the direction of motion but never change the speed mathematical calculation edit for moving objects the quantity of work time power is calculated thus at any instant the rate of the work done by a force measured in joules second or watts is the scalar product of the force a vector and the velocity vector of the point of application this scalar product of force and velocity is classified as instantaneous power just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance by the fundamental theorem of calculus the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application 5 work is the result of a force on a point that moves through a displacement as the point moves it follows a curve x with a velocity v at each instant the small amount of work δw that occurs over an instant of time dt is calculated as δ w f ⋅ d s f ⋅ v d t displaystyle delta w mathbf f cdot d mathbf s mathbf f cdot mathbf v dt where the f ⋅ v is the power over the instant dt the sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work w ∫ t 1 t 2 f ⋅ v d t ∫ t 1 t 2 f ⋅ d s d t d t ∫ c f ⋅ d s displaystyle w int t 1 t 2 mathbf f cdot mathbf v dt int t 1 t 2 mathbf f cdot tfrac d mathbf s dt dt int c mathbf f cdot d mathbf s where c is the trajectory from x t1 to x t2 this integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle and is therefore said to be path dependent if the force is always directed along this line and the magnitude of the force is f then this integral simplifies to w ∫ c f d s displaystyle w int c f ds where s is displacement along the line if f is constant in addition to being directed along the line then the integral simplifies further to w ∫ c f d s f ∫ c d s f s displaystyle w int c f ds f int c ds fs where s is the displacement of the point along the line this calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line followed by the particle in this case the dot product f ⋅ ds f cos θ ds where θ is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement 5 that is w ∫ c f ⋅ d s f s cos ⁡ θ displaystyle w int c mathbf f cdot d mathbf s fs cos theta in the notable case of a force applied to a body always at an angle of 90° from the velocity vector as when a body moves in a circle under a central force no work is done at all since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero thus no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit this is ideal as all orbits are slightly elliptical also no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge work done by a variable force edit calculating the work as force times straight path segment would only apply in the most simple of circumstances as noted above if force is changing or if the body is moving along a curved path possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done and only the component of the force parallel to the application point velocity is doing work positive work when in the same direction and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity this component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called scalar tangential component f cos ⁡ θ displaystyle scriptstyle f cos theta where θ displaystyle scriptstyle theta is the angle between the force and the velocity and then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows work of a force is the line integral of its scalar tangential component along the path of its application point if the force varies e.g compressing a spring we need to use calculus to find the work done if the force is given by f x a function of x then the work done by the force along the x-axis from a to b is w ∫ a b f s ⋅ d s displaystyle w int limits a b mathbf f s cdot d mathbf s torque and rotation edit a force couple results from equal and opposite forces acting on two different points of a rigid body the sum resultant of these forces may cancel but their effect on the body is the couple or torque t the work of the torque is calculated as d w t ⋅ ω → d t displaystyle dw mathbf t cdot vec omega dt where the t ⋅ ω is the power over the instant δt the sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the rigid body yields the work w ∫ t 1 t 2 t ⋅ ω → d t displaystyle w int t 1 t 2 mathbf t cdot vec omega dt this integral is computed along the trajectory of the rigid body with an angular velocity ω that varies with time and is therefore said to be path dependent if the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction then it takes the form ω → ϕ ˙ s displaystyle vec omega dot phi mathbf s where φ is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector s in this case the work of the torque becomes w ∫ t 1 t 2 t ⋅ ω → d t ∫ t 1 t 2 t ⋅ s d ϕ d t d t ∫ c t ⋅ s d ϕ displaystyle w int t 1 t 2 mathbf t cdot vec omega dt int t 1 t 2 mathbf t cdot mathbf s frac d phi dt dt int c mathbf t cdot mathbf s d phi where c is the trajectory from φ t1 to φ t2 this integral depends on the rotational trajectory φ t and is therefore path-dependent if the torque t is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that t τ s displaystyle mathbf t tau mathbf s and both the torque and angular velocity are constant then the work takes the form 6 w ∫ t 1 t

considering the torque as arising from a force of constant magnitude f being applied perpendicularly to a lever arm at a distance r as shown in the figure this force will act through the distance along the circular arc s rφ so the work done is w f s f r ϕ displaystyle w fs fr phi introduce the torque τ fr to obtain w f r ϕ τ ϕ displaystyle w fr phi tau phi as presented above notice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work work and potential energy edit the scalar product of a force f and the velocity v of its point of application defines the power input to a system at an instant of time integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application c x t defines the work input to the system by the force path dependence edit therefore the work done by a force f on an object that travels along a curve c is given by the line integral w ∫ c f ⋅ d x ∫ t 1 t 2 f ⋅ v d t displaystyle w int c mathbf f cdot d mathbf x int t 1 t 2 mathbf f cdot mathbf v dt where dx t defines the trajectory c and v is the velocity along this trajectory in general this integral requires the path along which the velocity is defined so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent the time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power d w d t p t f ⋅ v displaystyle frac dw dt p t mathbf f cdot mathbf v path independence edit if the work for an applied force is independent of the path then the work done by the force is by the gradient theorem the potential function evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application such a force is said to be conservative this means that there is a potential function u x that can be evaluated at the two points x t1 and x t2 to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points it is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential that is w ∫ c f ⋅ d x ∫ x t 1 x t 2 f ⋅ d x u x t 1 − u x t 2 displaystyle w int c mathbf f cdot mathrm d mathbf x int mathbf x t 1 mathbf x t 2 mathbf f cdot mathrm d mathbf x u mathbf x t 1 u mathbf x t 2 the function u x is called the potential energy associated with the applied force examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces in this case the gradient of work yields ∇ w − ∇ u − ∂ u

potential 7 because the potential u defines a force f at every point x in space the set of forces is called a force field the power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work or potential in the direction of the velocity v of the body that is p t − ∇ u ⋅ v f ⋅ v displaystyle p t nabla u cdot mathbf v mathbf f cdot mathbf v work by gravity edit gravity f mg does work w mgh along any descending path in the absence of other forces gravity results in a constant downward acceleration of every freely moving object near earth s surface the acceleration due to gravity is g 9.8 m⋅s−2 and the gravitational force on an object of mass m is fg mg it is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the center of mass of the object if an object is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance y2 − y1 the work w done on the object by its weight mg is w f g y 2 − y 1 f g Δ y − m g Δ y displaystyle w f g y 2 y 1 f g delta y mg delta y where fg is weight pounds in imperial units and newtons in si units and Δy is the change in height y notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object the presence of

forces in springs assembled in parallel consider a spring that exerts a horizontal force f −kx 0 0 that is proportional to its deflection in the x direction independent of how a body moves the work of

energy also known as the work–energy principle states that the work done by all forces acting on a particle the work of the resultant force equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle 8

principle begins with newton s second law and the resultant force on a particle which includes forces applied to the particle and constraint forces imposed on its movement computation of the scalar product of the forces with the velocity of the particle evaluates the instantaneous power added to the system 9 constraints define the direction of movement of the particle by ensuring there is no component of velocity in the direction of the constraint force this also means the constraint forces do not add to the instantaneous power the time integral of this scalar equation yields work from the instantaneous power and kinetic energy from the scalar product of velocity and acceleration the fact the work–energy principle eliminates the constraint forces underlies lagrangian mechanics 10 this section focuses on the work–energy principle as it applies to particle dynamics in more general systems work can change the potential energy of a mechanical device the thermal energy in a thermal system or the electrical energy in an electrical device work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another derivation for a particle moving along a straight line edit in the case the resultant force f is constant in both magnitude and direction and parallel to the velocity of the particle the particle is moving with constant acceleration a along a straight line 11 the relation

constrained movement edit in particle dynamics a formula equating work applied to a system to its change in kinetic energy is obtained as a first integral of newton s second law of motion it is useful to notice that the resultant force used in newton s laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle remarkably the work of a constraint force is zero therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the work–energy principle to see this consider a particle p that follows the trajectory x t with

airport after finishing the first few chapters miranda began to envision the life of hamilton as a musical and researched whether a stage musical of hamilton s life had been created all he found was that a play of hamilton s story had been done on broadway in 1917 starring george arliss as alexander hamilton 47 miranda therefore began a project entitled the hamilton mixtape on may 12 2009 miranda was invited to perform music from in the heights at the white house evening of poetry music and the spoken word instead he performed the first song from the hamilton mixtape a rough version of what would later become alexander hamilton hamilton s opening number he spent a year after that working on my shot another early number from the show 48 miranda performed in a workshop production of the

residence for two years or more 60 on its opening attended by author miranda the chicago production received strongly positive reviews 61 62 63 miranda praised the chicago casts performance during a later television interview 64 u.s touring productions 2017 edit plans for a national tour of hamilton emerged near the end of january 2016 the tour was initially announced with over 20 stops scheduled from 2017 through at least 2020 65 tickets to the tour s run in san francisco—its debut city—sold out within 24 hours of release the number of people who entered the online waiting room to purchase tickets surpassed 110,000 66 the first national touring production began preview performances at san francisco s shn orpheum theatre on march 10 2017 and officially opened on march 23 the production ran in san francisco until august 5 when it transferred to los angeles hollywood pantages theatre for a run from august 11 to december 30 2017 just days after the first u.s tour began performances in san francisco news emerged that a second u.s tour of hamilton would begin in seattle for a six-week limited engagement before touring north america concurrently with the first tour 11 to distinguish the first and second touring productions the production team has labeled them respectively the angelica tour and the philip tour 65 the angelica tour alone requires 14 truckloads of cargo and a core group of over 60 traveling cast crew and musicians 65 the production team insisted that each tour must be able to duplicate the original broadway show s choreography which literally revolves around two concentric turntables on the stage 65 this led to the construction of four portable sets two for each tour so that one set can be assembled well in advance at the next stop while the tour is still playing at the last stop 65 west end 2017 edit cameron mackintosh will produce a london production which will re-open the victoria palace theatre currently undergoing a refurbishment following the closure of billy elliot the musical on december 21 2017 following previews from december 6 10 initial principal casting was announced on january 26 2017 20 box office and business edit the musical s engagement at the off-broadway public theater was sold out 6 when the musical opened on broadway it had a multimillion-dollar advance in ticket sales reportedly taking in 30 million before its official opening 67 hamilton was the second-highest-grossing show on broadway for the labor day week ending september 6 2015 behind only the lion king 68 as of september 2015 the show has been sold out for most of its broadway engagement 7 hamilton like other broadway musicals offers a lottery before every show twenty-one front row seats and occasional standing room are given out in the lottery chosen winners are able to purchase two tickets at 10 each unlike other broadway shows hamilton s lottery process drew in large crowds of people that created a significant congestion problems for west 46th street 69 even though many people were not able to win the lottery hamilton creator lin-manuel miranda prepared mini-performances right before the lotteries were drawn they were dubbed the ham4ham shows due to the fact that if you won you gave a hamilton a 10 bill in exchange for seeing the show people were then able to experience a part of the show even when they did not win the lottery 70 the lottery was eventually placed online to avoid increasing crowds and dangerous traffic conditions 71 on its first day more than 50,000 people entered which resulted in the website crashing 72 trevor boffone who in his essay on howlround wrote ham4ham follows a long tradition of latina o or the ancestors of present-day latina os theatremaking that dates back to when the events in hamilton were happening . the philosophy behind this is simple if the people won t come to the theatre then take the theatre to the people while el teatro campesino s taking it to the streets originated from a place of social protest ham4ham does so to create accessibility tap into social media and ultimately generate a free self-functioning marketing campaign in this way ham4ham falls into a lineage of accessibility as a latina o theatremaking aesthetic 73 following miranda s departure from the show on july 9 2016 rory o malley then playing king george iii took over as the host of ham4ham 74 the ham4ham show officially ended on august 31 2016 after over a year of performances though the lottery still continues daily 75 hamilton set a broadway box office record for the most money grossed in a single week in new york city in late november 2016 it grossed 3.3 million for an eight performance week the first show to break 3 million in eight performances 76 critical response edit marilyn stasio in her review of the off-broadway production for variety wrote the music is exhilarating but the lyrics are the big surprise the sense as well as the sound of the sung dialogue has been purposely suited to each character george washington a stately figure in jackson s dignified performance sings in polished prose.. but in the end miranda s impassioned narrative of one man s story becomes the collective narrative of a nation a nation built by immigrants who occasionally need to be reminded where they came from 77 the hamilton cast and crew greets president barack obama on july 18 2015 in his review of the off-broadway production jesse green in new york wrote the conflict between independence and interdependence is not just the show s subject but also its method it brings the complexity of forming a union from disparate constituencies right to your ears... few are the theatergoers who will be familiar with all of miranda s touchstones i caught the verbal references to rodgers and hammerstein gilbert and sullivan sondheim west side story and 1776 but other people had to point out to me the frequent hat-tips to hip-hop.. whether it s a watershed a breakthrough and a game changer as some have been saying is another matter miranda is too savvy and loves his antecedents too much to try to reinvent all the rules at once... those duels by the way—there are three of them—are superbly handled the highlights of a riveting if at times overbusy staging by the director thomas kail and the choreographer andy blankenbuehler 78 although giving a positive review elisabeth vincentelli of the new york post which was founded by hamilton himself wrote that hamilton and burr s love hate relationship fails to drive the show—partly because miranda lacks the charisma and intensity of the man he portrays and that too many of the numbers are exposition-heavy lessons as if this were schoolhouse rap the show is burdened with eye-glazingly dull stretches especially those involving george washington 79 ben brantley in reviewing the broadway production in the new york times wrote i am loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit broadway show but hamilton directed by thomas kail and starring mr miranda might just about be worth it... washington jefferson madison—they re all here making war and writing constitutions and debating points of economic structure so are aaron burr and the marquis de lafayette they wear the clothes by paul tazewell you might expect them to wear in a traditional costume drama and the big stage they inhabit has been done up by david korins to suggest a period-appropriate tavern where incendiary youth might gather to drink brawl and plot revolution 1 david cote in his review of the broadway production for time out new york wrote i love hamilton i love it like i love new york or broadway when it gets it right and this is so right.. a sublime conjunction of radio-ready hip-hop as well as r b britpop and trad showstoppers under-dramatized american history and miranda s uniquely personal focus as a first-generation puerto rican and inexhaustible wordsmith hamilton hits multilevel culture buttons hard.. the work s human drama and novelistic density remain astonishing he chose hamilton as a critics pick and gave the production five out of five stars 3 a review in the economist notes that the production enjoys near-universal critical acclaim 80 barack obama joked that admiration for the musical is the only thing dick cheney

best albums of 2015 98 2 rolling stone 50 best albums of 2015 99 8 concept edit the names of many main characters including that of elizabeth schuyler hamilton are given a unique melodic motif that is repeated throughout the musical hamilton in various keys tempos and timbres depending on the context this is one example of how hamilton weaves melodic and lyrical reprises into later songs in the score in order to cue an emotional response according to an article in the new yorker the show is an achievement of historical and cultural reimagining the costumes and set reflect the period with velvet frock coats and knee britches the set ..is a wooden scaffold against exposed brick the warm lighting suggests candlelight 4 the musical is mostly sung and rapped all the way through with little dialogue isolated outside of the musical score 16 2 100 casting diversity edit miranda said that the portrayal of hamilton thomas jefferson george washington and other white historical figures by black and hispanic actors should not require any substantial suspension of disbelief by audience members our cast looks like america looks now and that s certainly intentional he said it s a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door 101 he noted we re telling the story of old dead white men but we re using actors of color and that makes the story more immediate and more accessible to a contemporary audience 102 the pro-immigration message of hamilton is at the forefront as the show revolves around the life of one of the founding fathers of america alexander hamilton and how he made his mark in american politics as an immigrant instead of being characterized as a white person alexander hamilton s immigrant status would be referenced throughout the whole show alongside with the virtue and prowess of hamilton by working a lot harder by being a lot smarter by being a self-starter described in the show s opening in order to foster a positive image of immigrants 103 alongside this the casting of black latino and asian american leads allowed audiences to literally view america as a nation of immigrants with the intention of showing how irrelevant the founding fathers whiteness is to their claim on the country 104 hamilton is a story about america and the most beautiful thing about it is.. it s told by such a diverse cast with a such diverse styles of music according to renee elise goldberry who played angelica schuyler we have the opportunity to reclaim a history that some of us don t necessarily think is our own 105 miranda has stated that he is totally open to women playing the founding fathers 106 casting for the british production is expected to feature predominantly black british artists 107 108 historical accuracy edit chronology and events edit although hamilton was based on true events miranda did use some dramatic license in retelling the story for example while angelica did have a strong relationship with hamilton it was exaggerated in the show during satisfied angelica explains why hamilton is not suitable for her despite wanting him in particular she states i m a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich my father has no sons so i m the one who has to social climb for one in actuality angelica had less pressure on her to do this philip schuyler actually had fifteen children including two sons who survived into adulthood one of whom was new york state assemblyman philip jeremiah schuyler and angelica had eloped with john barker church three years before she met hamilton at her sister s wedding when she was already mother of two of her eight children with church 109 miranda stated that he chose to do this because it is stronger dramatically if angelica is available but cannot marry him 110 111 112 in addition in act i burr s role in hamilton s life is overstated and much of the early interactions between the two men in the show are fictionalized for example while burr was present at the battle on monmouth burr did not serve as charles lee s second in his duel with john laurens as seen in ten duel commandments lee s second was evan edwards 113 hamilton also never approached burr to help write the federalist papers as portrayed in non-stop 114 during act i the character of aaron burr says that ..martha washington named her feral tomcat after him hamilton to which alexander hamilton replies that s true 115 in fact it is false the idea of hamilton as a serial adulterer has been one of the biggest mischaracterizations of the real alexander hamilton for centuries with celebrated authors repeating the story over and over again notwithstanding that the sexual connotation of tomcat as a womanizer did not appear in dictionaries until the first half of the 20th century the tomcat story has been previously discredited by author stephen knott 116 and refuted by historian and author michael e newton at the alexander hamilton discoveries and findings talk held by the alexander hamilton awareness society at liberty hall kean university as part of the 2016 celebratehamilton events 117 118 in act ii there are multiple inaccuracies throughout hamilton s decline probably due to time constraints and narrative arc while it is true that john adams and hamilton did not particularly get along john adams did not fire hamilton as told in the show hamilton tendered his resignation from his position as secretary of the treasury on december 1 1794 119 two years before adams became president however hamilton remained close friends with washington and highly influential in the political sphere 120 in addition jefferson madison and burr did not approach hamilton about his affair it was actually james monroe frederick muhlenberg and abraham venable in december 1792 121 monroe was a close friend of jefferson s and shared the information of hamilton s affair with him in the summer of 1797 journalist james callender broke the story of hamilton s infidelity hamilton blamed monroe and the altercation nearly ended in a duel 122 with nothing left to do hamilton then published the reynolds pamphlet 123 in blow us all away george eacker and philip hamilton engage in a duel before the events of the 1800 presidential election the duel actually occurred in 1801 with philip hamilton dying on november 24 in the show eacker fires on philip at the count of seven while what happened in real-life is almost the opposite both men refused to fire for over a minute before eacker shot philip in the hips 124 lastly it was not the presidential election of 1800 that led to burr and hamilton s duel burr did become jefferson s vice-president but when jefferson decided to not run with burr for reelection in 1804 burr opted to run for governor of new york instead burr lost to morgan lewis in a landslide afterwards a letter was published from charles d cooper to philip schuyler claiming that hamilton called burr a dangerous man and one who ought not be trusted with the reins of government and that he knew of a still more despicable opinion which general hamilton has expressed of mr burr 125 this led to the letters between burr and hamilton as seen in the show in your obedient servant critical analysis and scholarship edit the show has been critiqued for a simplistic depiction of hamilton and vilification of jefferson joanne b freeman a history professor at yale 126 contrasted the show s hamilton to the real hamilton who was a mass of contradictions an immigrant who sometimes distrusted immigrants a revolutionary who placed a supreme value on law and order a man who distrusted the rumblings of the masses yet preached his politics to them more frequently and passionately than many of his more democracy-friendly fellows 127 australian historian shane white found the framing of the show s story troubling stating that he and many historian colleagues would like to imagine that hamilton is a last convulsion of the founding father mythology 128 according to white miranda s depiction of the founding of the united states infuses new life into an older view of american history that centered on the founding fathers instead of joining the many historians who were attempting to get away from the great men story by incorporating ordinary people african-americans native americans and women into a more inclusive and nuanced historical narrative in which hamilton has a cameo rather than leading role 128 rutgers university professor lyra monteiro criticized the show s multi-ethnic casting as obscuring a complete lack of identifiable enslaved or free persons of color as characters in the show 129 monteiro identified other commentators such as ishmael reed who criticized the show for making hamilton and other historical personages appear more progressive on racial injustice than they really were 129 according to reed hamilton s reputation has been shored up as an abolitionist and someone who was opposed to slavery which reed stated was untrue 130 in the baffler policy analyst matt stoller criticized the musical s portrayal of hamilton as an idealist committed to democratic principles in contrast to what he characterized as the historical record of hamilton s reactionary anti-democratic politics and legacy 131 for example stoller cited hamilton as a leader involved in the newburgh conspiracy a military coup plot against the continental congress in 1783 his development of a national financial system which in stoller s view empowered the plutocratic elite and his use of military force indefinite detention and mass arrests against dissenters during the whiskey rebellion of 1791 131 in 2007 history writer william hogeland criticized chernow s biography of hamilton on similar grounds in the boston review 132 use in education edit kqed news wrote of a growing number of intrepid u.s history teachers...who

student who believes that stories about 18th century america are distant and irrelevant as it shows the founding fathers were real humans with real feeling and real flaws rather than bloodless two-dimensional cutouts who devoted their lives to abstract principles 133 a high school teacher from the bronx noted his students were singing these songs the way they might sing the latest release from drake or adele 134 one teacher focused on hamilton s ability to write his way out of trouble and toward a higher plane of existence skilled writing is the clearest sign of scholarship—and the best way to rise up and alter your circumstance 135 hamilton s producers have made a pledge to allow 20,000 new york city public high school students from low-income families to get subsidized tickets

jackson with harriet tubman on the 20 bill 142 hamilton the revolution edit on april 12 2016 miranda and jeremy mccarter s book hamilton the revolution was released detailing hamilton s journey from

however trump demanded an apology 148 for what he described on twitter as the cast having harassed pence 149 this led to an online campaign called boycotthamilton which became widely mocked as the show is already sold-out months in advance 150 trump was criticized by the washington post who noted the division between white and non-white america in the 2016 presidential election and suggested trump could have offered assurances that he would be a president for all americans—that he would respect everybody regardless of race or gender or creed 151 instead as presidential historian robert dallek expressed trump s twitter response was a striking act of divisiveness by an incoming president struggling to heal the nation after a bitter election 151 with the hamilton cast a proxy for those fearful of trump s policies and rhetoric jeffrey seller the show s lead producer said that while trump has not seen hamilton or inquired about tickets he is welcome to attend 152 parodies edit in

ˌmædəˈɡæskər malagasy madagasikara officially the republic of madagascar malagasy repoblikan i madagasikara republiˈkʲan madaɡasˈkʲarə̥ french république de madagascar and previously known as the malagasy republic is an island country in the indian ocean off the coast of east africa the nation comprises the island of madagascar the fourth-largest island in the world and numerous smaller peripheral islands following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent gondwana madagascar split from the indian peninsula around 88 million years ago allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation consequently madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot over 90 of its wildlife is found nowhere else on earth the island s diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats the first archaeological evidence for human foraging on madagascar dates to 2000 bc human settlement of madagascar occurred between 350 bc and ad 550 by austronesian peoples arriving on outrigger canoes from borneo these were joined around ad 1000 by bantu migrants crossing the mozambique channel from east africa other groups continued to settle on madagascar over time each one making lasting contributions to malagasy cultural life the malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more sub-groups of which the largest are the merina of the central highlands until the late 18th century the island of madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances beginning in the early 19th century most of the island was united and ruled as the kingdom of madagascar by a series of merina nobles the monarchy collapsed in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the french colonial empire from which the island gained independence in 1960 the autonomous state of madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods termed republics since 1992 the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at antananarivo however in a popular uprising in 2009 president marc ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in march 2009 to andry rajoelina constitutional governance was restored in january 2014 when hery rajaonarimampianina was named president following a 2013 election deemed fair and transparent by the international community madagascar is a member of the united nations the african union au the southern african development community sadc and the organisation internationale de la francophonie madagascar belongs to the group of least developed countries according to the united nations 11 malagasy and french are both official languages of the state the majority of the population adheres to traditional beliefs christianity or an amalgamation of both ecotourism and agriculture paired with greater investments in education health and private enterprise are key elements of madagascar s development strategy under ravalomanana these investments produced substantial economic growth but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class as of 2017 update the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis and quality of life remains low for the majority of the malagasy population etymology edit in the malagasy language the island of madagascar is called madagasikara madaɡasʲˈkʲarə̥ and its people are referred to as malagasy 12 the island s appellation madagascar is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the middle ages by europeans 13 the name madageiscar was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th-century venetian explorer marco polo as a corrupted transliteration of the name mogadishu the somali port with which polo had confused the island 14 on st laurence s day in 1500 portuguese explorer diogo dias landed on the island and named it são lourenço polo s name was preferred and popularized on renaissance maps no single malagasy-language name predating madagasikara appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited 14 geography edit main article geography of madagascar the terraced paddy fields of the central highlands of madagascar left give way to tropical rainforest along the eastern coast center bordered by the shores of the indian ocean right at 592,800 square kilometres 228,900 sq mi 15 madagascar is the world s 47th largest country 6 and the fourth-largest island 15 the country lies mostly between latitudes 12°s and 26°s and longitudes 43°e and 51°e 16 neighboring islands include the french territory of réunion and the country of mauritius to the east as well as the state of comoros and the french territory of mayotte to the north west the nearest mainland state is mozambique located to the west the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent gondwana separated the madagascar–antarctica–india landmass from the africa–south america landmass around 135 million years ago madagascar later split from india about 88 million years ago allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation 17 along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island s remaining tropical lowland forest to the west of this ridge lies a plateau in the center of the island ranging in altitude from 750 to 1,500 m 2,460 to 4,920 ft above sea level these central highlands traditionally the homeland of the merina people and the location of their historic capital at antananarivo are the most densely populated part of the island and are characterized by terraced rice-growing valleys lying between grassy hills and patches of the subhumid forests that formerly covered the highland region to the west of the highlands the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the mozambique channel and mangrove swamps along the coast 18 the grassy plains that dominate the western landscape are dotted with stony massifs left patches of deciduous forest and baobab trees center while the south is characterized by desert and spiny forests right madagascar s highest peaks rise from three prominent highland massifs maromokotro 2,876 m 9,436 ft in the tsaratanana massif is the island s highest point followed by boby peak 2,658 m 8,720 ft in the andringitra massif and tsiafajavona 2,643 m 8,671 ft in the ankaratra massif to the east the canal des pangalanes is a chain of man-made and natural lakes connected by canals built by the french just inland from the east coast and running parallel to it for some 600 km 370 mi 19 the western and southern sides which lie in the rain shadow of the central highlands are home to dry deciduous forests spiny forests and deserts and xeric shrublands due to their lower population densities madagascar s dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau the western coast features many protected harbors but silting is a major problem caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains 19 climate edit a köppen climate classification map of madagascar biogeographic timetable of madagascar over the last 200 million years see also geography of madagascar § climate the combination of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season november–april with frequently destructive cyclones and a relatively cooler dry season may–october rain clouds originating over the indian ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island s eastern coast the heavy precipitation supports the area s rain forest ecosystem the central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island 18 tropical cyclones annually cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life 20 in 2004 cyclone gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit madagascar the storm killed 172 people left 214,260 homeless 21 and caused more than us 250 million in damage 22 ecology edit main articles wildlife of madagascar flora of madagascar fauna of madagascar agroecology in madagascar ecoregions of madagascar and list of world heritage sites in madagascar the island s iconic traveller s palm ravinala features in the national emblem as a result of the island s long isolation from neighboring continents madagascar is home to an abundance of plants and animals found nowhere else on earth 23 24 approximately 90 of all plant and animal species found in madagascar are endemic 25 including the lemurs a type of strepsirrhine primate the carnivorous fossa and many birds this distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to madagascar as the eighth continent 26 and the island has been classified by conservation international as a biodiversity hotspot 23 more than 80 percent of madagascar s 14,883 plant species are found nowhere else in the world including five plant families 27 the family didiereaceae composed of four genera and 11 species is limited to the spiny forests of southwestern madagascar 18 four-fifths of the world s pachypodium species are endemic to the island 28 three-fourths 29 of madagascar s 860 27 orchid species are found here alone as are six of the world s nine baobab species 30 the island is home to around 170 palm species three times as many as on all of mainland africa 165 of them are endemic 29 many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions the drugs vinblastine 31 32 and vincristine 31 33 are vinca alkaloids 34 35 used to treat hodgkin s disease 36 leukemia 37 and other cancers 38 were derived from the madagascar periwinkle 39 40 the traveler s palm known locally as ravinala 41 and endemic to the eastern rain forests 42 is highly iconic of madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the air madagascar logo 43 the ring-tailed lemur is one of over 100 known species and subspecies of lemur found only in madagascar 44 like its flora madagascar s fauna is diverse and exhibits a high rate of endemism lemurs have been characterized as madagascar s flagship mammal species by conservation international 23 in the absence of monkeys and other competitors these primates have adapted to a wide range of habitats and diversified into numerous species as of 2012 update there were officially 103 species and subspecies of lemur 45 39 of which were described by zoologists between 2000 and 2008 46 they are almost all classified as rare vulnerable or endangered at least 17 species of lemur have become extinct since humans arrived on madagascar all of which were larger than the surviving lemur species 47 a number of other mammals including the cat-like fossa are endemic to madagascar over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island of which over 60 percent including four families and 42 genera are endemic 23 the few families and genera of reptile that have reached madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species with over 90 percent of these being endemic 48 including one endemic family 23 the island is home to two-thirds of the world s chameleon species 48 including the smallest known 49 and researchers have proposed that madagascar may be the origin of all chameleons endemic fish of madagascar include two families 15 genera and over 100 species primarily inhabiting the island s freshwater lakes and rivers although invertebrates remain poorly studied on madagascar researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species all 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic as are a majority of the island s butterflies scarab beetles lacewings spiders and dragonflies 23 environmental issues edit main articles deforestation in madagascar and illegal logging in madagascar tavy slash-and-burn destruction of native forest habitat is widespread left causing massive erosion center and silting of rivers right madagascar s varied fauna and flora are endangered by human activity 50 since the arrival of humans around 2,350 years ago madagascar has lost more than 90 percent of its original forest 51 this forest loss is largely fueled by tavy fat a traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practice imported to madagascar by the earliest settlers 52 malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice not only for its practical benefits as an agricultural technique but for its cultural associations with prosperity health and venerated ancestral custom fomba malagasy 53 as human population density rose on the island deforestation accelerated beginning around 1400 years ago 54 by the 16th century the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests 52 more recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1000 years ago a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century 55 according to a conservative estimate about 40 percent of the island s original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000 with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80 percent 56 in addition to traditional agricultural practice wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks although banned by then-president marc ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009 the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in january 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of andry rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following ravalomanana s ousting 57 it is anticipated that all the island s rainforests excluding those in protected areas and the steepest eastern mountain slopes will have been deforested by 2025 58 invasive species have likewise been introduced by human populations following the 2014 discovery in madagascar of the asian common toad a relative of a toad species that has severely harmed wildlife in australia since the 1930s researchers warned the toad could wreak havoc on the country s unique fauna 59 habitat destruction and hunting have threatened many of madagascar s endemic species or driven them to extinction the island s elephant birds a family of endemic giant ratites became extinct in the 17th century or earlier most probably due to human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their large eggs for food 60 numerous giant lemur species vanished with the arrival of human settlers to the island while others became extinct over the course of the centuries as a growing human population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and among some populations increased the rate of lemur hunting for food 61 a july 2012 assessment found that the exploitation of natural resources since 2009 has had dire consequences for the island s wildlife 90 percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction the highest proportion of any mammalian group of these 23 species were classified as critically endangered by contrast a previous study in 2008 had found only 38 percent of lemur species were at risk of extinction 45 in 2003 ravalomanana announced the durban vision an initiative to more than triple the island s protected natural areas to over 60,000 km2 23,000 sq mi or 10 percent of madagascar s land surface as of 2011 update areas protected by the state included five strict nature reserves réserves naturelles intégrales 21 wildlife reserves réserves spéciales and 21 national parks parcs nationaux 62 in 2007 six of the national parks were declared a joint world heritage site under the name rainforests of the atsinanana these parks are marojejy masoala ranomafana zahamena andohahela and andringitra 63 local timber merchants are harvesting scarce species of rosewood trees from protected rainforests within marojejy national park and exporting the wood to china for the production of luxury furniture and musical instruments 64 to raise public awareness of madagascar s environmental challenges the wildlife conservation society opened an exhibit entitled madagascar in june 2008 at the bronx zoo in new york 65 history edit main article history of madagascar early period edit malagasy ancestry reflects a blend of austronesian southeast asian and bantu east african roots the settlement of madagascar is a subject of ongoing research and debate archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 bc 66 67 traditionally archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between 350 bc and 550 ad while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250 ad in either case these dates make madagascar one of the last major landmasses on earth to be settled by humans 68 early settlers arrived in outrigger canoes from southern borneo upon arrival early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation the first settlers encountered madagascar s abundance of megafauna including giant lemurs elephant birds giant fossa and the malagasy hippopotamus which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction 69 by 600 ad groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands 70 arab traders first reached the island between the seventh and ninth centuries 71 a wave of bantu-speaking migrants from southeastern africa arrived around 1000 ad they introduced the zebu a type of long-horned humped cattle which they kept in large herds 52 by 1600 irrigated paddy fields were developed in the central highland betsileo kingdom and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring kingdom of imerina a century later 70 the rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century 52 the oral histories of the merina people who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago describe encountering an established population they called the vazimba probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced austronesian settlement wave the vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the merina kings andriamanelo ralambo and andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries 72 today the spirits of the vazimba are revered as tompontany ancestral masters of the land by many traditional malagasy communities 73 arab and european contacts edit a pirate cemetery at Île sainte-marie madagascar was an important transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the indian ocean in the early centuries following human settlement the written history of madagascar began with the arabs who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced islam the arabic script used to transcribe the malagasy language in a form of writing known as sorabe arab astrology and other cultural elements 20 european contact began in 1500 when the portuguese sea captain diogo dias sighted the island 15 the french established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century 20 from about 1774 to 1824 madagascar gained prominence among pirates and european traders particularly those involved in the trans-atlantic slave trade the small island of nosy boroha off the northeastern coast of madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of libertalia 74 many european sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island among them robert drury whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern madagascar during the 18th century 75 the wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century 76 among these were the betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the sakalava chiefdoms of menabe and boina on the west coast the kingdom of imerina located in the central highlands with its capital at the royal palace of antananarivo emerged at around the same time under the leadership of king andriamanelo 77 kingdom of madagascar edit main article merina kingdom king andrianampoinimerina 1787–1810 upon its emergence in the early 17th century the highland kingdom of imerina was initially a minor power relative to the larger coastal kingdoms 77 and grew even weaker in the early 18th century when king andriamasinavalona divided it among his four sons following almost a century of warring and famine imerina was reunited in 1793 by king andrianampoinimerina 1787–1810 78 from his initial capital ambohimanga 79 and later from the rova of antananarivo this merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities his ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor king radama i 1810–28 who was recognized by the british government as king of madagascar radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the british governor of mauritius to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for british military and financial assistance artisan missionary envoys from the london missionary society began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as james cameron david jones and david griffiths who established schools transcribed the malagasy language using the roman alphabet translated the bible and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island 80 radama s successor queen ranavalona i 1828–61 responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of britain and france by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of christianity in madagascar and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory residents of madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes including theft christianity and especially witchcraft for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory between 1828 and 1861 the tangena ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually 81 among those who continued to reside in imerina were jean laborde an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy and joseph-françois lambert a french adventurer and slave trader with whom then-prince radama ii signed a controversial trade agreement termed the lambert charter succeeding his mother radama ii 1861–63 attempted to relax the queen s stringent policies but was overthrown two years later by prime minister rainivoninahitriniony 1852–1865 and an alliance of andriana noble and hova commoner courtiers who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch 20 following the coup the courtiers offered radama s queen rasoherina 1863–68 the opportunity to rule if she would accept a power sharing arrangement with the prime minister—a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them 82 queen rasoherina accepted first wedding rainivoninahitriniony then later deposing him and wedding his brother prime minister rainilaiarivony 1864–95 who would go on to marry queen ranavalona ii 1868–83 and queen ranavalona iii 1883–97 in succession 83 over the course of rainilaiarivony s 31-year tenure as prime minister numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government 84 schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory army organization was improved and british consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers 85 polygamy was outlawed and christianity declared the official religion of the court in 1869 was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace 84 legal codes were reformed on the basis of british common law and three european-style courts were established in the capital city 85 in his joint role as commander-in-chief rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of madagascar against several french colonial incursions 85 french colonization edit main articles malagasy protectorate and french madagascar a french poster about the franco-hova war primarily on the basis that the lambert charter had not been respected france invaded madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first franco-hova war 86 at the end of the war madagascar ceded the northern port town of antsiranana diego suarez to france and paid 560,000 francs to lambert s heirs 87 in 1890 the british accepted the full formal imposition of a french protectorate on the island but french authority was not acknowledged by the government of madagascar to force capitulation the french bombarded and occupied the harbor of toamasina on the east coast and mahajanga on the west coast in december 1894 and january 1895 respectively 88 a french military flying column then marched toward antananarivo losing many men to malaria and other diseases reinforcements came from algeria and sub-saharan africa upon reaching the city in september 1895 the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery causing heavy casualties and leading queen ranavalona iii to surrender 89 france annexed madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year dissolving the merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on réunion island and to algeria a two-year resistance movement organized in response to the french capture of the royal palace was effectively put down at the end of 1897 90 under colonial rule plantations were established for the production of a variety of export crops 91 slavery was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed many remained in their former masters homes as servants 92 or as sharecroppers in many parts of the island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today 93 wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of antananarivo 94 and the rova palace compound was turned into a museum 95 additional schools were built particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the merina had not reached education became mandatory between the ages of 6 to 13 and focused primarily on french language and practical skills 96 the merina royal tradition of taxes paid in the form of labor was continued under the french and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to antananarivo 97 malagasy troops fought for france in world war i 15 in the 1930s nazi political thinkers developed the madagascar plan that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of europe s jews 98 during the second world war the island was the site of the battle of madagascar between the vichy government and the british 99 the occupation of france during the second world war tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement leading to the malagasy uprising of 1947 100 this movement led the french to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the loi cadre overseas reform act and madagascar moved peacefully towards independence 101 the malagasy republic was proclaimed on 14 october 1958 as an autonomous state within the french community a period of provisional government ended

high-level technical positions were filled by french expatriates and french teachers textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country popular resentment over tsiranana s tolerance for this neo-colonial arrangement inspired a series of farmer and student protests that overturned his administration in 1972 20 gabriel ramanantsoa a major general in the army was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975 colonel richard ratsimandrava appointed to succeed him was assassinated six days into his tenure general gilles andriamahazo ruled after ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee vice admiral didier ratsiraka who ushered in the socialist-marxist second republic that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993 this period saw a political alignment with the eastern bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity these policies coupled with economic pressures stemming from the 1973 oil crisis resulted in the rapid collapse of madagascar s economy and a sharp decline in living standards 20 and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979 the ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the international monetary fund world bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation s broken economy 103 ratsiraka s dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally within two months a transitional government had been established under the leadership of albert zafy 1993–96 who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the third republic 1992–2010 104 the new madagascar constitution established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the national assembly the new constitution also emphasized human rights social and political freedoms and free trade 20 zafy s term however was marred by economic decline allegations of corruption and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers he was consequently impeached in 1996 and an interim president norbert ratsirahonana was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001 103 the contested 2001 presidential elections in which then-mayor of antananarivo marc ravalomanana eventually emerged victorious caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of ravalomanana and ratsiraka the negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by ravalomanana s progressive economic and political policies which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism facilitated foreign direct investment and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally national gdp grew at an average rate of 7 percent per year under his administration in the later half of his second term ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption 103 opposition leader and then-mayor of antananarivo andry rajoelina led a movement in early 2009 in which ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a coup d état in march 2009 rajoelina was declared by the supreme court as the president of the high transitional authority an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections in 2010 a new constitution

center of the island king andrianjaka founded antananarivo as the capital of his imerina kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured vazimba capital on the hilltop of analamanga 72 as merina dominance expanded over neighboring malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the kingdom of madagascar antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island in 1896 the french colonizers of madagascar adopted the merina capital as their center of colonial administration the city remained the capital of madagascar after regaining independence in 1960 in 2017 the capital s population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants 109 the next largest cities are antsirabe 500,000 toamasina 450,000 and mahajanga 400,000 15 politics edit main articles

numerous popular protests several disputed elections an impeachment two military coups and one assassination the island s recurrent political crises are often prolonged with detrimental effects on the local economy international relations and malagasy living standards the eight-month standoff between incumbent ratsiraka and challenger marc ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson 110 a series of protests led by andry rajoelina against ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent with more than 170 people killed 111 modern politics in madagascar are colored by the history of merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century the consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence 112 madagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream african affairs despite being a founding member of the organisation of african unity which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the african union madagascar was not permitted to attend the first african union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election but rejoined the african union in july 2003 after a 14-month hiatus madagascar was again suspended by the african union in march 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to rajoelina 113 madagascar is a

including the universal declaration of human rights and the convention on the rights of the child 115 religious ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations 57 115 torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems ravalomanana s 2004 creation of bianco an anti-corruption bureau resulted in reduced corruption among antananarivo s lower-level bureaucrats in particular although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau 57 security edit main article military of madagascar the rise of centralized kingdoms among the sakalava merina and other ethnic groups produced the island s first standing armies by the 16th century initially equipped with spears but later with muskets cannons and other firearms 116 by the early 19th century the merina sovereigns of the kingdom of madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army of trained and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30,000 117 french attacks on coastal towns in the later part of the century prompted then-prime minister rainilaiarivony to solicit british assistance to provide training to the merina monarchy s army despite the training and leadership provided by british military advisers the malagasy army was unable to withstand french weaponry and was forced to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at antananarivo madagascar was declared a colony of france in 1897 118 the political independence and sovereignty of the malagasy armed forces which comprises an army navy and air force was restored with independence from france in 1960 119 since this time the malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest under the socialist second

forces are under the direction of the minister of the interior 107 and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis as during the protracted standoff between incumbent ratsiraka and challenger marc ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate this tradition was broken in 2009 when a segment of the army defected to the side of andry rajoelina then-mayor of antananarivo in support of his attempt to force president ravalomanana from power 57 the minister of the interior is responsible for the national police force paramilitary force gendarmerie and the secret police 107 the police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level however in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps 122 traditional community tribunals called dina are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak historically security has been relatively high across the island 57 violent crime rates are low and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft although child prostitution human trafficking and the production and sale of

rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice coffee cattle silk and palm oil popular dissatisfaction over these policies was a key factor in launching the socialist-marxist second republic in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles cotton and power and import–export trade and shipping were brought under state control madagascar s economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell industrial production dropped by 75 percent inflation

madagascar s government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s the political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of imf and world bank assistance conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under zafy who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the state before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon zafy s impeachment the imf agreed to write off half madagascar s debt in

in madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills as well as social and cultural values including respect for ancestors and elders 20 the first formal european-style school was established in 1818 at toamasina by members of the london missionary society lms the lms was invited by king radama i 1810–28 to expand its schools throughout imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children the schools were closed by ranavalona i in 1835 145 but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death by the end of the 19th century madagascar had the most developed and modern school system in pre-colonial sub-saharan africa access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period with french language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum during the post-colonial first republic a continued reliance on french nationals as teachers and french as the language of instruction displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power 20 consequently under the socialist second republic french instructors and other nationals were expelled malagasy was declared the language of instruction and a large cadre of young malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy 146 this policy known as malgachization coincided with a severe economic downturn and a dramatic decline in the quality of education those schooled during this period generally failed to master the french language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty excepting the brief presidency of albert zafy from 1992 to 1996 ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure 147 education was prioritized under the ravalomanana administration 2002–09 and is currently free and compulsory from ages 6 to 13 148 the primary schooling cycle is five years followed by four years at the lower secondary level and three years at the upper secondary level 20 during ravalomanana s first term thousands of new primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed older buildings were renovated and tens of thousands of new primary teachers were recruited and trained primary school fees were eliminated and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students 148 government school construction initiatives have ensured at least one primary school per fokontany and one lower secondary school within each commune at least one upper secondary school is located in each of the larger urban centers 122 the three branches of the national public university are located at antananarivo founded in 1961 mahajanga 1977 and fianarantsoa 1988 these are complemented by public teacher-training colleges and several private universities and technical colleges 20 as a result of increased educational access enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006 however education quality is weak producing high rates of grade repetition and dropout 148 education policy in ravalomanana s second term focused on quality issues including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate bepc to a high school leaving certificate bac and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom 149 public expenditure on education was 13.4 percent of total government expenditure and 2.9 percent of

constitutes an approximately equal blend of southeast asian and east african genes 151 152 although the genetics of some communities show a predominance of southeast asian or east african origins or some arab indian or european ancestry 153 southeast asian origins – specifically from the southern part of borneo – are most predominant among the merina of the central highlands 112 who form the largest malagasy ethnic sub-group at approximately 26 percent of the population while certain communities among the coastal peoples collectively called côtiers have relatively stronger east african

68,430 in 1958 101 to 17,000 three decades later there were an estimated 25,000 comorans 18,000 indians and 9,000 chinese living in madagascar in the mid-1980s 20 languages edit a malagasy child main articles malagasy language and languages of madagascar the malagasy language is of malayo-polynesian origin and is generally spoken throughout the island the numerous dialects of malagasy which are generally mutually intelligible 154 can be clustered under one of two sub-groups eastern malagasy spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the merina dialect of antananarivo and western malagasy spoken across the western coastal plains french became the official language during the colonial period when madagascar came under the authority of france in the first national constitution of 1958 malagasy and french were named the official languages of the malagasy republic madagascar is a francophone country and french is mostly spoken as a second language among the educated population and used for international communication 20 no official languages were recorded in the constitution of 1992 although malagasy was identified as the national language nonetheless many sources still claimed that malagasy and french were official languages eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in april 2000 on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the french language was unconstitutional the high constitutional court observed in its decision that in the absence of a language law french still had the character of an official language 155 in the constitution of 2007 malagasy remained the national language while official languages were reintroduced malagasy french and english 156 english was removed as an official language from the constitution approved by voters in the november 2010 referendum 1 the outcome of the referendum and its consequences for official and national language policy are not recognized by the political opposition who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness in the way the election was organized by the high transitional authority 104 language policy over the years madagascar has had different language policies under different influences of authority the indigenous language of madagascar malagasy was the predominant language on the island until the french colonization in 1897 malagasy has developed throughout the decades from an oral language to a language that has a written system latin orthography a change that was enforced by king radama i in 1823 following the french colonization the language of instruction and media changed from malagasy to almost exclusively french moreover the first french governor-general gallieni also encouraged the french officials to learn malagasy as well after the advent of the malagasy independence the madagascans tried to reinstate malagasy as a language of instruction especially in secondary schools however the language policy was inadequately planned and malagasy was struggling to surpass french as the language of instruction 157 today madagascar has two official languages malagasy and french madagascar managed to maintain the indigenous language malagasy in society and in schools despite the colonizing power malagasy and french are both the language of instruction in primary and secondary schools in madagascar the inclusion of the african language as a medium of instruction is usually uncommon in other colonized african countries 158 religion edit main article religion in madagascar religion in madagascar 2010

practice traditional religion 15 which tends to emphasize links between the living and the razana ancestors the veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building as well as the highlands practice of the famadihana whereby a deceased family member s remains are exhumed and re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb the famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor s memory reunite with family and community and enjoy a festive atmosphere residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party where food and rum are typically served and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present 160 consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to fady taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them it is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways they may intervene on behalf of the living conversely misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected the sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors in addition the malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god called zanahary or andriamanitra 161 over eighty percent of the malagasy are christian with practitioners of protestantism slightly outnumbering adherents to roman catholicism 15 in 1818 the london missionary society sent the first christian missionaries to the island where they built churches translated the bible into the malagasy language and began to gain converts beginning in 1835 queen ranavalona i persecuted these converts as part of an attempt to halt european cultural and political influence on the island in 1869 a successor queen ranavalona ii converted the court to christianity and encouraged christian missionary activity burning the sampy royal idols in a symbolic break with traditional beliefs 162 today many christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones related to honoring the ancestors for instance they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a christian minister to consecrate a famadihana reburial 160 the malagasy council of churches comprises the four oldest and most prominent christian denominations of madagascar roman catholic church of jesus christ in madagascar lutheran and anglican and has been an influential force in malagasy politics 163 islam is also practiced on the island islam was first brought to madagascar in the middle ages by arab and somali muslim traders who established several islamic schools along the eastern coast while the use of arabic script and loan words and the adoption of islamic astrology would spread across the island the islamic religion failed to take hold in all but a handful of southeastern coastal communities today muslims constitute 7 percent of the population of madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of mahajanga and antsiranana the vast majority of muslims are sunni muslims are divided between those of malagasy ethnicity indians pakistanis and comorians

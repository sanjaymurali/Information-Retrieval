intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale tropical depression thirteen formed on october 22 over the southwestern caribbean sea from a tropical wave that exited africa on october 10 it executed a small loop and while doing so intensified into tropical storm mitch a weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north after becoming disorganized due to wind shear from an upper-level low mitch quickly intensified in response to favorable conditions 1 including warm waters and good outflow 2 3 it became a hurricane on october 24 and developed an eye 4 after turning to the west mitch rapidly intensified first into a major hurricane on october 25 and then into a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the next day 1 at peak intensity mitch

lowest in the month of october and tied for the fourth lowest for any atlantic hurricane initially the national hurricane center nhc and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north threatening the yucatán peninsula instead mitch turned to the south due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active 1 land interaction imparted weakening 5 and the hurricane

significant aid totaling 6.3 billion 1998 usd throughout central america which was recovering from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996 many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy in addition after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes the affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring again 39 the run-off from mitch on november 1 hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes but many took this as an opportunity to rebuild stronger houses with a new structurally improved foundation homes were redesigned to be able to

disease 41 while stalling over the western caribbean sea mitch s strong winds produced strong waves damaging local coral reefs later the storm s immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water this resulted in diseases occurring within the coral however the hurricane s upwelling cooled the warm water temperatures preventing significant bleaching and destruction of the coral reef 42 mitch caused such massive and widespread damage that honduran president carlos roberto flores claimed it destroyed fifty years of progress in the country 8 honduras the country most affected by the

44 the honduran government distributed food water and medical services to the hurricane victims including the more than 4 million without water 39 in addition the country initially experienced a sharp

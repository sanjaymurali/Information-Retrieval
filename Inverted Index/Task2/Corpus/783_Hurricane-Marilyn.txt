hurricane marilyn was the fifteenth tropical depression and thirteenth named storm of the unusually busy 1995 atlantic hurricane season following closely on the heels of hurricane luis hurricane marilyn was the most powerful storm to hit the virgin islands since hurricane hugo of 1989 marilyn formed late in the utc day on september 13 and reached hurricane strength soon thereafter marilyn struck the lesser antilles on september 14 at category 1 strength and intensified to nearly category 3 strength by the time it reached the u.s virgin islands a hurricane hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail which is unusual for tropical cyclones after heading north past bermuda marilyn weakened and became extratropical on september 22 the remnant circulation wandered the atlantic ocean from september 23 – october 1 just south of nova scotia marilyn peaked at 115 mph 185 km h but was predicted to reach 125 mph 205 km h maximum category 3-status marilyn is directly responsible for thirteen deaths most due to drowning on boats or offshore eleven thousand people were left homeless on the island of st thomas and estimated damages were set at 2 billion 1995 usd 1 in the usvi the same area would be struck by hurricane bertha the next year while still repairing from hurricanes luis and marilyn 2 then successively hit by hortense erika georges jose lenny and debby meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale marilyn s origins were from a tropical wave that formed off the african coast on september 7 large low-level winds were included in the wave s circulation but little convection existed 3 the system continued west for a few days at about 19 mph 31 km h next to an anticyclonic aloft on september 12 satellite pictures viewed the disorganized wave and declared it tropical depression fifteen after convection had increased tropical depression fifteen strengthened rapidly becoming tropical storm marilyn six hours later one day after being named marilyn was upgraded to hurricane status while turning on a more northwesterly track 3 4 for the next few days marilyn s track took it towards the west-northwest and to the northwest due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge marilyn was a category 1 hurricane it passed 52 mi 84 km north of barbados and martinique 3 marilyn passed over dominica and just Îles des saintes and southwest of guadeloupe on september 14 bringing heavy rains and strong winds with it marilyn continued on its northwesterly track making landfall in the u.s virgin islands on september 15 packing winds of 110 mph 180 km h a strong category 2 strength hurricane the eyewall east-southeast of the center of marilyn passed over saint thomas later that day after passing over puerto rico marilyn entered back into the atlantic ocean on september 16 3 hurricane marilyn near puerto rico a low had formed near marilyn which may have enhanced outflow from the system an eye formed in the center of marilyn and the storm reached a peak intensity of 949 millibars and winds of only 115 mph 185 km h a lower-end category 3 hurricane at this time marilyn was predicted to peak in wind speeds of 120–125 mph 190–195 km h 5 6 7 8 reconnaissance data found a concentric pair of eyewall wind maxima marilyn started weakening rapidly falling from peak-level winds of 141 mph 227 km h down to 102 mph 164 km h 3 the central pressure also rose up 20 mbars in only 10 hours this rapid weakening was caused by westerly shear and dry air entrained in the system a decaying eyewall and especially cool waters upwelled from the previous powerful storm hurricane luis as marilyn weakened to category 1 hurricane status and moved north-northwest it passed about 174 mi 280 km west of bermuda on september 19 as marilyn encountered more westerly shear it weakened to below hurricane status and made its extratropical transition on september 20 centered in the northeastern atlantic 3 the remnant circulation continued to erratically move through the central atlantic ocean for another 10 days before being absorbed by a frontal low on september 30 a hurricane hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail which is unusual for tropical cyclones 3 preparations edit hurricane marilyn on crossing the virgin islands on september 15 1995 seventeen watches and or warnings were issued in association with marilyn 3 the first two were a tropical storm watch and a tropical storm warning issued on barbados st vincent grenadines st lucia and grenada on september 12 at 2200 utc five hours

hurricane warning was issued for barbados st vincent grenadines st lucia and a hurricane watch for dominica 3 11 a hurricane watch as released for martinique on september 14 the 2100 utc september 13 was extended for the grenadines through st martin except guadeloupe st barthelemy and french portion of st martin at 1500 utc puerto rico was put under a hurricane watch 3 12 at 1700 utc guadeloupe st barthelemy and french portion of st martin were put under a hurricane watch four hours later puerto rico u.s and british virgin islands and guadeloupe were put under a hurricane warning 3 throughout the night several watches and warnings were discontinued at 1500 utc september 15 dominican republic from cabrera to cabo engano were put under a hurricane watch as marilyn approached during the night of september 16 all currently active watches and warnings were discontinued at around the same time a new hurricane watch was released for turks and caicos and mayaguana acklins and the crooked islands of the southeastern bahamas 8 13 14 15 this warning was discontinued within 48 hours at 1500 utc september 18 bermuda came under a tropical storm watch which was upgraded to a warning in six

2.3 billion and 13 deaths throughout the united states virgin islands and puerto rico the exact figure for damages in the u.s virgin islands and puerto rico is not available although the american insurance services group set the combined damage at 875 million aside from high winds and seas one possible explanation for the storm s heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations marilyn followed on the heels of luis a more powerful category 4 hurricane initially predicted to pass very close to st thomas this prediction prompted locals to be particularly thorough in their pre-storm preparations however luis passed further away from the island and caused relatively moderate damage virgin islanders questioned the accuracy of the national hurricane center wind advisories as hurricane marilyn caused significant damage for a mere category 2 storm damage on st thomas was remiscent of the damage seen on st croix in 1989 when hurricane hugo a category 4 storm caused catastrophic damage because st thomas is a very hilly island it is possible that sustained winds on exposed hills some of which have elevations that are thousands of feet above sea level were significantly stronger than the sea-level wind speed estimates given by the hurricane center in its main advisory residents also reported tornado vortices in certain neighborhoods 3

were sent to puerto rico and the u.s virgin islands officials of fema set up camps on the islands to give out food water and shelter supplies 33 u.s virgin islands edit fema distributed food water clothing in the u.s virgin islands president of the united states bill clinton declared the u.s virgin islands a federal disaster area making it available to federal aid however the national guard did not appear on st thomas until two days following the hurricane and fema did not appear until three days following in the meantime significant looting particularly of grocery stores prevented an orderly distribution of food and water 30 five supply distribution sites were being operated by the virgin islands territorial emergency management agency vitema more than 2,100 federal agency personnel had been deployed to help out with the cleanup from hurricane marilyn four contracts were quickly accepted for immediate building repairs diving teams were sent to check for harbor damage and united states navy seabees started working on repairing public buildings military and security forces included about 500 army air force and navy personnel 500 national guardsmen and 500 federal law enforcement personnel the airport in st thomas was open for flight using a mobile control tower the st thomas hospital was open but was running on generators 34 the first fema disaster recovery

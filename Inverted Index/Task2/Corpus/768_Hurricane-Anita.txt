and pacific hurricane seasons hurricane anita was a powerful atlantic hurricane during an otherwise quiet 1977 atlantic hurricane season the first tropical cyclone of the season anita developed from a tropical wave on august 29 in the north-central gulf of mexico it tracked westward into an area with conditions favorable for further development and quickly intensified into a hurricane by late on august 30 initially anita was forecast to strike texas though a building ridge turned it to the west-southwest the hurricane rapidly strengthened to attain peak winds of 175 mph 280 km h and on september 2 anita made landfall in eastern tamaulipas as a category 5 hurricane it quickly weakened as it crossed mexico and after briefly redeveloping into a tropical depression in the eastern pacific ocean anita dissipated on september 4 to the south of the baja california peninsula the hurricane produced light rainfall and high tides along the gulf coast of the united states some low-level flooding was reported but damage was slight in mexico the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall the winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern mexico with about 25,000 people left homeless the rainfall reaching over 17.52 inches 445 mm caused flooding and mudslides which killed eleven people in tamaulipas overall damage is unknown meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on august 16 the wave axis tracked steadily westward and on august 23 convection increased after the wave passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low by august 27 the wave axis was located over cuba with the area of convection located between florida and the bahamas after tracking northwestward the disturbance crossed southern florida and after entering the gulf of mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development it tracked slowly westward at 5 mph 7 km h and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on august 29 while located about 230 miles 370 km south-southwest of new orleans louisiana 1 with a ridge of high pressure to its north the depression tracked westward favorable conditions persisted for several days prior to the arrival of the depression and as such the depression quickly intensified into tropical storm anita the storm tracked slowly over warm water temperatures and throughout its duration it was embedded within warm moist tropical air anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on august 30 1 this is the latest date for the first hurricane since 1967 2 initially it threatened to strike texas though building high pressures to the north of the hurricane turned anita to the west-southwest the hurricane developed a well-defined eye and hurricane anita began to rapidly intensify late on september 1 after attaining major hurricane status during a two-day period up to its peak intensity anita deepened at a rate of 2 mbar per hour and on september 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175 mph 280 km h while located just offshore northeastern mexico making anita a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale 1 hurricane anita maintained its strength as it approached land and at 1100 utc on september 2 it made landfall on soto la marina tamaulipas about 145 miles 235 km south of brownsville texas or 80 miles 130 km north of tampico mexico moving ashore with a pressure of 926 mbar anita was the third most intense tropical cyclone to strike the nation and was the most intense hurricane to hit from the gulf of mexico 2 3 it rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of mexico and on september 3 about 25 hours after moving ashore anita emerged into the eastern pacific ocean as a tropical depression reclassified as tropical depression eleven the system continued to the west and weakened further after encountering cooler water temperatures the depression gradually lost its deep convection and on september 4 it dissipated off of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula 4 preparations edit hurricane anita near its mexico landfall shortly after first developing one oil company evacuated its oil rigs off of texas and louisiana by helicopter with several other companies beginning to evacuate unneeded workers 5 ultimately 7,000 oil workers were removed from offshore oil platforms 1 the threat of the developing disturbance prompted officials to close a state park in southern louisiana the national hurricane center advised small craft along the northern gulf coast to remain at port 5 initially anita was predicted to continue tracking west-northwestward and make landfall near the texas louisiana border as a result schools in cameron parish louisiana were closed 6 and on august 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern louisiana and northeastern texas coastlines after the track shifted further to the south the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between brownsville and just south of corpus christi texas 1 an emergency shelter was opened in brownwood texas and army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations 7 an official from the national weather service recommended evacuation for all residents east of galveston texas living in an area below 5 feet 1.5 m above sea level about 20,000 left cameron louisiana 8 in all about 58,000 people evacuated coastal locations in louisiana and texas 1 though the national hurricane center did not issue hurricane warnings for mexico officials warned the mexican government of the potential danger of the hurricane across the northeastern coastline of the country 35,000 people evacuated prior to the arrival of the hurricane 1 including all of the residents in the village where the hurricane struck 9 the mexican army assisted in evacuations and preparing emergency shelters 10 impact edit

the 1995 atlantic hurricane season hurricane opal was a category 4 hurricane that caused severe damage along the northern gulf coast of the united states in october 1995 opal was the ninth hurricane and the strongest of the abnormally active 1995 atlantic hurricane season it crossed the yucatán peninsula while still a tropical depression on september 27 then strengthened and moved northward in the gulf becoming the most powerful category 4 atlantic hurricane before making a second landfall october 4 in the florida panhandle near pensacola as a 115-mph 185-km h hurricane opal devastated the pensacola panhandle area with a 15-ft 5-m storm surge and traveled up the entire state of alabama becoming a tropical storm in tennessee opal also caused heavy damage in the mid-atlantic states before dissipating throughout the storm s path from central america into the ohio valley 63 people died in storm-related events losses attributed to opal exceeded 5.1 billion much of which took place in the united states the name opal was retired in 1996 replaced by olga for the 2001 season meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the origins of hurricane opal were linked using satellite imagery and synoptic analyses to a tropical wave that left the western coast of africa on september 11 1 ten days later the disturbance had crossed the central atlantic and had reached the lesser antilles 2 continuing to track westward the disturbance showed little signs of organization before entering the western caribbean sea on september 23 there the wave became entangled with a broad area of low-pressure east of nicaragua and the combined system drifted west-northwestward toward the yucatán peninsula even then the disturbance lacked any significant development however a burst of thunderstorm activity occurred near the storm s center on september 27 prompting the national hurricane center  nhc to declare the system a tropical depression at 18 00 utc that day at the time the depression was centered 80 mi 130 km south-southeast of cozumel mexico 1 the primordial depression meandered across the yucatán peninsula during the three days following tropical cyclogenesis due to the lack of dominant steering currents despite remaining over land for an extended period the depression developed organized rainbands and ships in the region reported weather conditions that were suggestive of a stronger system as a result the nhc upgraded the disturbance to tropical storm intensity at 12 00 utc on september 30 while the storm was over the north-central coast of yucatán this classification resulted in the tropical cyclone being named opal which also made it the first atlantic storm to be given a name starting with the letter o 3 over the next two days opal would enter the gulf of mexico and track slowly west-southwestward into the bay of campeche there the storm strengthened into a hurricane at 12 00 utc on october 2 shortly afterward a primitive eye began to form at the same time a strong trough tracking across the united states caused opal to slowly turn northeastward 1 after clearing the bay of campeche opal accelerated towards the united states gulf coast the combination of warm sea surface temperatures associated with an unusually warm pocket of warm ocean waters and an upper-level high pressure area over the gulf of mexico resulted in a highly conductive environment for intensification 1 4 after a significant reorganization in opal s internal structure the hurricane was able to rapidly intensify in these favorable conditions at 12 00 utc on october 4 opal reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph 240 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 916 hpa 27.05 inhg making it a category 4 on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale the tropical cyclone s eye measured 12 mi 19 km at peak intensity as the storm was beginning an eyewall replacement cycle the progression of this cycle resulted in opal s gradual weakening thereafter at 22 00 utc that day opal made landfall between pensacola beach florida and cape san blas as a category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph 185 km h weakening quickened as opal moved further inland degenerating into a tropical depression over tennessee less than a day after landfall the diffusing cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly afterwards these extratropical remnants tracked towards the northeast before they were last noted along the northern coast of lake ontario in quebec 1 preparations edit hurricane opal near peak intensity on october 4 although opal was a weak system located over the yucatán peninsula at the time 350 people evacuated from grand isle louisiana on september 28 after rough surf associated with the distant cyclone began to threaten louisiana highway 1—the only thoroughfare connecting grand isle with the louisianan mainland 5 the following day oil companies operating offshore oil drilling platforms in the gulf of mexico began evacuating workers from the rigs to land 6 on october 1 a coastal flood watch was issued for portions of the united states coast due to the risk of storm surge from opal the united states coast guard issued an advisory for boaters in the gulf of mexico to use caution or remain in port where possible the next day the galveston texas emergency operations center opened to monitor the tropical cyclone and deliberate upon potential preparations for the city 7 meanwhile the launch space shuttle columbia s sts-73 mission set for october 5 was postponed due to opal s anticipated effects 8 on october 3 a voluntary evacuation order was placed on plaquemines parish louisiana due to the risks of potential storm surge schools were also closed by noon that day across the parish 9 voluntary evacuation orders for the florida panhandle which would ultimately be the most heavily affected area also began the same day with several counties giving evacuation orders farther west a mandatory evacuation order was placed on mobile county alabama by then-governor fob james just before noon october 4 with the hurricane near landfall escambia okaloosa and santa rosa counties halted evacuations instead ordering those still within vulnerable areas to seek shelter instead however the large amount of evacuees led to severe traffic congestion escambia county officials estimated that tens of thousands were still on evacuation routes within the county only a few hours before opal made landfall mass evacuations in some other counties concluded during the afternoon of october 4 though many evacuees in other locations were unable to reach safe areas prior to the onset of gale-force winds 10 an estimated 100,000 people evacuated from the united states gulf coast ahead of opal with 5 percent of evacuees seeking public shelters and over half of evacuees seeking shelter out of their home counties in their post-storm assessment the federal emergency management agency  fema noted that the landfalls of hurricane allison and hurricane erin on the florida panhandle earlier in the year produced a dichotomous mood toward preparations for hurricane opal—some people may have taken a wait and see approach that resulted in complacency while others affected by the widespread power outages caused by erin may have acquired a greater sense of readiness toward the approaching hurricane regardless the overall evacuation process was described as chaotic and the failure to clear hurricane evacuation routes of casual or communal traffic was blamed for the relative unease during evacuations for opal traffic congestion on these routes caused some evacuees to return to vulnerable areas along the coast while raising fears that stranded evacuees on highways could be subjected to potentially fatal hurricane-force winds 10 the post-landfall watches and warnings released in accordance with opal were a flash flood warning released on october 5 for portions of alabama northern georgia and the western parts of north carolina and south carolina 11 the warning also included eastern tennessee a flash flood watch was also in effect for portions of the upper ohio valley the mid-atlantic region the central appalachians and the lower great lakes wind warnings were in effect for northwestern south carolina all the way to western new york 11 a gale watch was also in effect for lake erie lake ontario and the southern sections of the st lawrence seaway six hours later the gale warnings over lake erie lake ontario and the southern sections of the st lawrence seaway were upgraded into a storm warning for erie alone the gale warning for the other two sections remained the shoreline of lake erie was under a beach erosion warning from buffalo new york to ripley new york 12 the storm prediction center released a tornado watch for northern and central new jersey and portions of new york and connecticut on october 6 13 significant non-surge areas of escambia county florida south of us 98 were included in evacuation areas because of the potential for isolation by flooding 14 tropical cyclone watches and warnings edit summary of tropical cyclone warnings and watches associated with hurricane opal 1 date time issued warning type areas changes to previous

areas comparing itself to hurricane eloise which struck the same area at near equal strength in 1975 damage from hurricane opal opal caused about us 5.1 billion 1995 dollars in damage making it the third costliest hurricane at the time most of the structural damage occurred near the coastline on the florida panhandle due to intense surge amazingly enough nearly a mile of u.s highway 98 near eglin air force base was completely destroyed the pavement was nearly replaced by mounds of sand left behind after storm surge 22 opal also spawned an f2 tornado that killed a young woman in florida

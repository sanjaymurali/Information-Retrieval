extreme amount of precipitation in a short period of time 1 sometimes accompanied by hail and thunder that is capable of creating flood conditions a cloudburst can suddenly dump large amounts of water e.g 25 mm of precipitation corresponds to 25000 metric tons km2 1 inch corresponds to 72,300 short tons over one square mile however cloudbursts are infrequent as they occur only via orographic lift or occasionally when a warm air parcel mixes with cooler air resulting in sudden condensation at times a large amount of runoff from higher elevations is mistakenly conflated with a cloudburst the term cloudburst arose from the notion that clouds were akin to water balloons and could burst resulting in rapid precipitation though this idea has since been disproven the term remains in use properties edit rainfall rate equal to or greater than 100 millimetres 3.9 in per hour is a cloudburst 2 3 however different definitions are used e.g the swedish weather service smhi defines the corresponding swedish term skyfall as 1 mm min for short bursts and 50 mm h for longer rainfalls the associated convective cloud can extend up to a height of 15 kilometres 9.3 mi above the ground 4 during a cloudburst more than 20 millimetres 0.79 in of rain may fall in a few minutes the results of cloudbursts can be disastrous cloudbursts are also responsible for flash flood creation rapid precipitation from cumulonimbus clouds is possible due to the langmuir precipitation process in which large droplets can grow rapidly by coagulating with smaller droplets which fall down slowly it is not essential that cloudbursts occur only when a cloud clashes with a solid body like a mountain they can also occur when hot water vapor mingles into the cold resulting in sudden condensation record

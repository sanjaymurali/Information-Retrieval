inspection law of 1730 mandated that all tobacco grown in the colony must be brought to locally designated public warehouses for inspection before sale one of the sites designated for a warehouse on

following the 1745 settlement of the virginia s 10 year dispute with lord fairfax over the western boundary of the northern neck proprietary when the privy council in london found in favor of lord fairfax s expanded claim some of the fairfax county gentry formed the ohio company of virginia they intended to conduct trade into the interior of america and they required a trading center near the

shoreline touting the advantages of the tobacco warehouse site 8 since the river site was amidst his estate philip opposed the idea and strongly favored a site at the head of hunting creek also known as great hunting creek it has been said that in order to avoid a predicament the petitioners offered to name the new town alexandria in honor of philip s family as a result philip and his cousin captain john alexander 1711–1763 gave land to assist in the development of alexandria and are thus listed as the founders this john was the son of robert alexander ii 1688–1735 on may 2 1749 the house

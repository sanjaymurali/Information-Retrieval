state in the southeastern 6 and mid-atlantic 7 regions of the united states located between the atlantic coast and the appalachian mountains virginia is nicknamed the old dominion due to its status as the first english colonial possession established in mainland north america 8 and mother of presidents because eight u.s presidents were born there more than any other state the geography and climate of the commonwealth are shaped by the blue ridge mountains and the chesapeake bay which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna the capital of the commonwealth is richmond virginia beach is the most populous city and fairfax county is the most populous political subdivision the commonwealth s estimated population as of 2017 update is over 8.4 million 2 the area s history begins with several indigenous groups including the powhatan in 1607 the london company established the colony of virginia as the first permanent new world english colony slave labor and the land acquired from displaced native american tribes each played a significant role in the colony s early politics and plantation economy virginia was one of the 13 colonies in the american revolution and joined the confederacy in the american civil war during which richmond was made the confederate capital and virginia s northwestern counties seceded to form the state of west virginia although the commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following reconstruction both major national parties are competitive in modern virginia 9 the virginia general assembly is the oldest continuous law-making body in the new world 10 the state government was ranked most effective by the pew center on the states in both 2005 and 2008 11 it is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally manages local roads and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms virginia s economy has many sectors agriculture in the shenandoah valley federal agencies in northern virginia including the headquarters of the u.s department of defense and central intelligence agency cia and military facilities in hampton roads the site of the region s main seaport geography main article environment

total area of 42,774.2 square miles 110,784.7 km2 including 3,180.13 square miles 8,236.5 km2 of water making it the 35th-largest state by area 13 virginia is bordered by maryland and washington d.c to the north and east by the atlantic ocean to the east by north carolina to the south by tennessee to the southwest by kentucky to the west and by west virginia to the north and west virginia s boundary with maryland and washington d.c extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the potomac river 14 the southern border is defined as the 36° 30′ parallel north though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes 15 the border with tennessee was not settled until 1893 when their dispute was brought to the u.s supreme court 16 geology and terrain the chesapeake bay separates the contiguous portion of the commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of virginia s eastern shore the bay was formed from the drowned river valleys of the susquehanna river and the james river 17 many of virginia s rivers flow into the chesapeake bay including the potomac rappahannock york and james which create three peninsulas in the bay 18 19 deciduous and evergreen trees give the blue ridge mountains their distinct color 20 the tidewater is a coastal plain between the atlantic coast and the fall line it includes the eastern shore and major estuaries of chesapeake bay the piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock-based foothills east of the mountains which were formed in the mesozoic era 21 the region known for its heavy clay soil includes the southwest mountains around charlottesville 22 the blue ridge mountains are a physiographic province of the appalachian mountains with the highest points in the state the tallest being mount rogers at 5,729 feet 1,746 m 23 the ridge and valley region is west of the mountains and includes the great appalachian valley the region is carbonate rock based and includes massanutten mountain 24 the cumberland plateau and the cumberland mountains are in the southwest corner of virginia south of the allegheny plateau in this region rivers flow northwest with a dendritic drainage system into the ohio river basin 25 the virginia seismic zone has not had a history of regular earthquake activity earthquakes are rarely above 4.5 in magnitude because virginia is located away from the edges of the north american plate the largest earthquake at an estimated 5.9 magnitude was in 1897 near blacksburg 26 a 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck central virginia on august 23 2011 near mineral the earthquake was reportedly felt as far away as toronto atlanta and florida 27 coal mining takes place in the three mountainous regions at 45 distinct coal beds near mesozoic basins 28 over 62 million tons of other non-fuel resources such as slate kyanite sand or gravel were also mined in virginia in 2012 29 the state s carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 caves ten of which are open for tourism 30 35 million years ago a bolide impacted what is now eastern virginia the resulting crater may explain sinking and earthquakes in the region 31 climate main article climate of virginia virginia state-wide averages climate

seasonal extremes vary from average lows of 26 °f −3 °c in january to average highs of 86 °f 30 °c in july the atlantic ocean has a strong effect on eastern and southeastern coastal areas of the state influenced by the gulf stream coastal weather is subject to hurricanes most pronouncedly near the mouth of chesapeake bay 33 in spite of its position adjacent to the atlantic ocean even the coastal areas have a significant continental influence with quite large temperature differences between summer and winter particularly given the state climate s subtropical classification which is typical of states in the upper south virginia has an annual average of 35–45 days of thunderstorm activity particularly in the western part of the state 34 and an average annual precipitation of 42.7 inches 108 cm 33 cold air masses arriving over the mountains in winter can lead to significant snowfalls such as the blizzard of 1996 and winter storms of 2009–2010 the interaction of these elements with the state s topography creates distinct microclimates in the shenandoah valley the mountainous southwest and the coastal plains 35 virginia averages seven tornadoes annually most f2 or lower on the fujita

in the lowland tidewater and piedmont yellow pines tend to dominate with bald cypress wetland forests in the great dismal and nottoway swamps other common trees and plants include red bay wax myrtle dwarf palmetto tulip poplar mountain laurel milkweed daisies and many species of ferns the largest areas of wilderness are along the atlantic coast and in the western mountains where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in north america are found 32 43 the atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the south atlantic pine forests and lower southeast coastal plain maritime flora the latter found primarily in eastern and central virginia white-tailed deer also known as virginia deer graze at big meadows in shenandoah national park mammals include white-tailed deer black bear beaver bobcat coyote raccoon skunk groundhog virginia opossum gray fox red fox and eastern cottontail rabbit 44 other mammals include nutria fox squirrel gray squirrel

virginia s quadricentennial year celebrating 400 years since the establishment of the jamestown colony the celebrations highlighted contributions from native americans africans and europeans each of which had a significant part in shaping virginia s history 53 54 warfare including among these groups has also had an important role virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the french and indian war the american revolution and the civil war to the cold war and the war on terrorism 55 stories about historic figures such as those surrounding pocahontas and john smith george washington s childhood or the plantation elite in the slave society of the antebellum period have also created potent myths of state history and have served as rationales for virginia s ideology 56 colony main article colony of virginia the first people are estimated to have arrived in virginia over 12,000 years ago 57 by 5,000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged and farming began by 900 ad by 1500 the algonquian peoples had founded towns such as werowocomoco in the tidewater region which they referred to as tsenacommacah the other major language groups in the area were the siouan to the west and the iroquoians who included the nottoway and meherrin to the north and south after 1570 the algonquians consolidated under chief powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network 58 powhatan controlled more than 30 smaller tribes and over 150 settlements who shared a common virginia algonquian language in 1607 the native tidewater population was between 13,000 and 14,000 59 several european expeditions including a group of spanish jesuits explored the chesapeake bay during the 16th century 60 in 1583 queen elizabeth i of england granted walter raleigh a charter to plant a colony north of spanish florida 61 in 1584 raleigh sent an expedition to the atlantic coast of north america 62 the name virginia may have been suggested then by raleigh or elizabeth perhaps noting her status as the virgin queen and may also be related to a native phrase wingandacoa or name wingina 63 initially the name applied to the entire coastal region from south carolina to maine plus the island of bermuda 64 later subsequent royal charters modified the colony s boundaries the london company was incorporated as a joint stock company by the proprietary charter of 1606 which granted land rights to this area the company financed the first permanent english settlement in the new world jamestown named for king james i it was founded in may 1607 by christopher newport 65 in 1619 colonists took greater control with an elected legislature called the house of burgesses with the bankruptcy of the london company in 1624 the settlement was taken into royal authority as an english crown colony 66 williamsburg was virginia s capital from 1699 to 1780 life in the colony was perilous and many died during the starving time in 1609 and the anglo-powhatan wars including the indian massacre of 1622 which fostered the colonists negative view of all tribes 67 by 1624 only 3,400 of the 6,000 early settlers had survived 68 however european demand for tobacco fueled the arrival of more settlers and servants 69 the headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to virginia 70 african workers were first imported to jamestown in 1619 initially under the rules of indentured servitude the shift to a system of african slavery in virginia was propelled by the legal cases of john punch who was sentenced to lifetime slavery in 1640 for attempting to run away 71 and of john casor who was claimed by anthony johnson as his servant for life in 1655 72 slavery first appears in virginia statutes in 1661 and 1662 when a law made it hereditary based on the mother s status 73 tensions and the geographic differences between the working and ruling classes led to bacon s rebellion in 1676 by which time current and former indentured servants made up as much as 80 of the population 74 rebels largely from the colony s frontier were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes and one result of the rebellion was the signing at middle plantation of the treaty of 1677 which made the signatory tribes tributary states and was part of a pattern of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty middle plantation saw the founding of the college of william mary in 1693 and was renamed williamsburg as it became the colonial capital in 1699 75 in 1747 a group of virginian speculators formed the ohio company with the backing of the british crown to start english settlement and trade in the ohio country west of the appalachian mountains 76 france which claimed this area as part of their colony of new france viewed this as a threat and the ensuing french and indian war became part of the seven years war 1756–1763 a militia from several british colonies called the virginia regiment was led by then-lieutenant colonel george washington 77 statehood 1851 painting of patrick henry s speech before the house of burgesses on the virginia resolves against the stamp act of 1765 the british parliament s efforts to levy new taxes following the french and indian war were deeply unpopular in the colonies in the house of burgesses opposition to taxation without representation was led by patrick henry and richard henry lee among others 78 virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773 and sent delegates to the continental congress the following year 79 after the house of burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774 virginia s revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the virginia conventions on may 15 1776 the convention declared virginia s independence from the british empire and adopted george mason s virginia declaration of rights which was then included in a new constitution 80 another virginian thomas jefferson drew upon mason s work in drafting the national declaration of independence 81 when the american revolutionary war began george washington was selected to head the colonial army during the war the capital was moved to richmond at the urging of governor thomas jefferson who feared that williamsburg s coastal location would make it vulnerable to british attack 82 in 1781 the combined action of continental and french land and naval forces trapped the british army on the virginia peninsula where troops under george washington and comte de rochambeau defeated british general cornwallis in the siege of yorktown his surrender on october 19 1781 led to peace negotiations in paris and secured the independence of the colonies 83 virginians were instrumental in writing the united states constitution james madison drafted the virginia plan in 1787 and the bill of rights in 1789 81 virginia ratified the constitution on june 25 1788 the three-fifths compromise ensured that virginia with its large number of slaves initially had the largest bloc in the house of representatives together with the virginia dynasty of presidents this gave the commonwealth national importance in 1790 both virginia and maryland ceded territory to form the new district of columbia though the virginian area was retroceded in 1846 84 virginia is called mother of states because of its role in being carved into states like kentucky which became the 15th state in 1792 and for the numbers of american pioneers born in virginia 85 civil war and aftermath main article virginia in the american civil war union soldiers before marye s heights fredericksburg in may 1863 in addition to agriculture slave labor was increasingly used in mining shipbuilding and other industries 86 the execution of gabriel prosser in 1800 nat turner s slave rebellion in 1831 and john brown s raid on harpers ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery and its role in the plantation economy by 1860 almost half a million people roughly 31 of the total population of virginia were enslaved 87 88 this division contributed to the start of the american civil war virginia voted to secede from the united states on april 17 1861 after the battle of fort sumter and abraham lincoln s call for volunteers on april 24 virginia joined the confederate states of america which chose richmond as its capital 85 after the 1861 wheeling convention 48 counties in the northwest separated to form a new state of west virginia which chose to remain loyal to the union virginian general robert e lee took command of the army of northern virginia in 1862 and led invasions into union territory ultimately becoming commander of all confederate forces during the war more battles were fought in virginia than anywhere else including bull run the seven days battles chancellorsville and the concluding battle of appomattox court house 89 after the capture of richmond in april 1865 the state capital was briefly moved to lynchburg 90 while the confederate leadership fled to danville 91 virginia was formally restored to the united states in 1870 due to the work of the committee of nine 92 during the post-war reconstruction era virginia adopted a constitution which provided for free public schools and guaranteed political civil and voting rights 93 the populist readjuster party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white democratic party gained power after 1883 94 it passed segregationist jim crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the constitution of virginia to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most african americans and many poor european americans 95 though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded due to a lack of political representation african americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in virginia society 96 post-reconstruction many pre-dreadnought and world war i-era warships were built in newport news including the uss virginia new economic forces also changed the commonwealth virginian james albert bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new industrial scale production centered on richmond in 1886 railroad magnate collis potter huntington founded newport news shipbuilding which was responsible for building six major world war i-era battleships for the u.s navy from 1907 to 1923 97 during the war german submarines like u-151 attacked ships outside the port 98 in 1926 dr w.a.r goodwin rector of williamsburg s bruton parish church began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of john d rockefeller jr 99 though their project like others in the state had to contend with the great depression and world war ii work continued as colonial williamsburg became a major tourist attraction 100 the virginia civil rights memorial was erected in 2008 to commemorate the protests which led to school desegregation protests started by barbara rose johns in 1951 in farmville against segregated schools led to the lawsuit davis v county school board of prince edward county this case filed by richmond natives spottswood robinson and oliver hill was decided in 1954 with brown v board of education which rejected the segregationist doctrine of separate but equal but in 1958 under the policy of massive resistance led by the influential segregationist senator harry f byrd and his byrd organization the commonwealth prohibited desegregated local schools from receiving state funding 101 the civil rights movement gained many participants in the 1960s it achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 in 1964 the united states supreme court ordered prince edward county and others to integrate schools 102 in 1967 the court also struck down the state s ban on interracial marriage with loving v virginia from 1969 to 1971 state legislators under governor mills godwin rewrote the constitution after goals such as the repeal of jim crow laws had been achieved in 1989 douglas wilder became the first african american elected as governor in the united states 103 the cold war led to the expansion of national defense government programs housed in offices in northern virginia near washington d.c. and correlative population growth 104 the central intelligence agency in langley was involved in various cold war events including as the target of soviet espionage activities also among the federal developments was the pentagon built during world war ii as the headquarters for the department of defense it was one of the targets of the september 11 attacks 189

it creates and sustains its own wind system it is most commonly a natural phenomenon created during some of the largest bushfires and wildfires although the word has been used to describe certain large fires 1 the phenomenon s determining characteristic is a fire with its own storm-force winds from every point of the compass 2 3 the black saturday bushfires and the great peshtigo fire are possible examples of forest fires with some portion of combustion due to a firestorm as is the great hinckley fire firestorms have also occurred in cities usually as a deliberate effect of targeted explosives such as occurred as a result of the aerial firebombings of hamburg dresden and the atomic bombing of hiroshima mechanism edit see also thermal column firestorm fire 1 updraft 2 strong gusty winds 3 a pyrocumulonimbus cloud a firestorm is created as a result of the stack effect as the heat of the original fire draws in more and more of the surrounding air this draft can be quickly increased if a low-level jet stream exists over or near the fire as the updraft mushrooms strong inwardly-directed gusty winds develop around the fire supplying it with additional air this would seem to prevent the firestorm from spreading on the wind but the tremendous turbulence created may also cause the strong surface inflow winds to change direction erratically firestorms resulting from the bombardment of urban areas in the second world war were generally confined to the areas initially seeded with incendiary devices and the firestorm did not appreciably spread outward 4 a firestorm may also develop into a mesocyclone and induce true tornadoes fire whirls this occurred with the 2002 durango fire 5 and probably with the much greater peshtigo fire 6 7 the greater draft of a firestorm draws in greater quantities of oxygen which significantly increases combustion thereby also substantially increasing the production of heat the intense heat of a firestorm manifests largely as radiated heat infrared radiation which may ignite flammable material at a distance ahead of the fire itself 8 9 not in citation given this also serves to expand the area and the intensity of the firestorm not in citation given violent erratic wind drafts suck movables into the fire and as is observed with all intense conflagrations radiated heat from the fire can melt asphalt some metals and glass and turn street tarmac into flammable hot liquid the very high temperatures ignite anything that might possibly burn until the firestorm runs low on fuel according to experts who a firestorm does not appreciably ignite material at a distance ahead of itself more accurately the heat desiccates those materials and makes them more vulnerable to ignition by embers or firebrands increasing the rate of fire spotting during the formation of a firestorm many fires merge to form a single convective column of hot gases rising from the burning area and strong fire-induced radial inwardly directed winds are associated with the convective column thus the fire front is essentially stationary and the outward spread of fire is prevented by the in-rushing wind 10 a firestorm is characterized by strong to gale-force winds blowing toward the fire everywhere around the fire perimeter an effect which is caused by the buoyancy of the rising column of hot gases over the intense mass fire drawing in cool air from the periphery these winds from the perimeter blow the fire brands into the burning area and tend to cool the unignited fuel outside the fire area so that ignition of material outside the periphery by radiated heat and fire embers is more difficult thus limiting fire spread 4 at hiroshima this inrushing to feed the fire is said to have prevented the firestorm perimeter from expanding and thus the firestorm was confined to the area of the city damaged by the blast 11 picture of a pyro-cumulonimbus taken from a commercial airliner cruising at about 10 km in 2002 various sensing instruments detected 17 distinct pyrocumulonimbus cloud events in north america alone 12 large wildfire conflagrations are distinct from firestorms if they have moving fire fronts which are driven by the ambient wind and do not develop their own wind system like true firestorms this does not mean that a firestorm must be stationary as with any other convective storm the circulation may follow surrounding pressure gradients and winds if those lead it onto fresh fuel sources furthermore non-firestorm conflagrations can develop from a single ignition whereas firestorms have only been observed where large numbers of fires are burning simultaneously over a relatively large area 13 with the important caveat that the density of simultaneously burning fires needs to be above a critical threshold for a firestorm to form a notable example of large numbers of fires burning simultaneously over a large area without a firestorm developing was the kuwaiti oil fires of 1991 where the distance between individual fires was too large the high temperatures within the firestorm zone ignite most everything that might possibly burn until a tipping point is reached that is upon running low on fuel which occurs after the firestorm has consumed so much of the available fuel within the firestorm zone that the necessary fuel density required to keep the firestorm s wind system active drops below the threshold level at which time the firestorm breaks up into isolated conflagrations in australia the prevalence of eucalyptus trees that have oil in their leaves results in forest fires that are noted for their extremely tall and intense flame front hence the bush fires appear more as a firestorm than a simple forest fire sometimes emission of combustible gases from swamps e.g., methane has a similar effect for instance methane explosions enforced the peshtigo fire 6 14 weather and climate effects edit firestorms will produce hot buoyant smoke clouds of primarily water vapor that will form condensation clouds as it enters the cooler upper atmosphere generating what is known as pyrocumulus clouds fire clouds or if large enough pyrocumulonimbus fire storm clouds for example the black rain that began to fall at 20 minutes after the atomic bombing of hiroshima produced in total 5–10 cm of black soot-filled rain in a 1–3 hour period 15 moreover if the conditions are right a large pyrocumulus can grow into a pyrocumulonimbus and produce lightning which could potentially set off further fires apart from city and forest fires pyrocumulus clouds can also be produced by volcanic eruptions due to the comparable amounts of hot buoyant material formed on a more continental and global extent away from the direct vicinity of the fire wildfire firestorms which produce pyrocumulonimbus cloud events have been found to surprisingly frequently generate minor nuclear winter effects 16 17 18 19 these are analogous to minor volcanic winters with each mass addition of volcanic gases additive in increasing the depth of the winter cooling from near-imperceptible to year without a summer levels city firestorms edit the same underlying combustion physics can also apply to man-made structures such as cities during war or natural disaster firestorms are thought to have been part of the mechanism of large urban fires such as accompanied the 1906 san francisco earthquake and the 1923 great kantō earthquake firestorms were also created by the firebombing raids of world war ii in cities like hamburg and dresden 20 of the two nuclear weapons used in combat only hiroshima resulted in a firestorm 1 in contrast experts suggest that due to the nature of modern u.s. city design and construction a firestorm is unlikely after a nuclear detonation 21 city event date of the firestorm notes bombing of hamburg in world war ii germany 20 27 july 1943 46,000 dead 22 a firestorm area of approximately 4.5 square miles 12 km2 was reported at hamburg 23 bombing of kassel in world war ii germany 22 october 1943 9,000 dead 24,000 dwellings destroyed area burned 23 square miles 60 km2 the percentage of this area which was destroyed by conventional conflagration and that destroyed by firestorm is unspecified 24 although a much larger area was destroyed by fire in kassel than even tokyo and hamburg the city fire caused a smaller less extensive firestorm than that at hamburg 25 bombing of darmstadt in world war ii germany 11 september 1944 8,000 dead area destroyed by fire 4 square miles 10 km2 again the percentage of this which was done by firestorm remains unspecified 20,000 dwellings and one chemical works destroyed and industrial production reduced 24 bombing of dresden in world war ii germany 20 13–14 february 1945 up to 25,000 dead 26 a firestorm area of approximately 8 square miles 21 km2 was reported at dresden 23 the attack was centered on the readily identifiable ostragehege sports stadium 27 bombing of tokyo in world war ii japan 9–10 march 1945 the firebombing of tokyo started many fires which converged into a devastating conflagration covering 16 square miles 41 km2 although often described as a firestorm event 28 29 the conflagration did not generate a firestorm as the high prevailing surface winds gusting at 17 to 28 mph 27 to 45 km h at the time of the fire overrode the fire s ability to form its own wind system 30 these high winds increased by about 50 the damage done by the incendiary bombs 31 there were 267,171 buildings destroyed and between 83,793 32 and 100,000 killed 33 making this the most lethal air raid in history with destruction to life and property greater than that caused by the use of nuclear weapons on hiroshima and nagasaki 34 35 prior to the attack the city had the highest population density of any industrial city in the world 36 bombing of ube yamaguchi in world war ii japan 1 july 1945 a momentary firestorm of about 0.5 square miles 1.3 km2 was reported at ube japan 23 the reports that the ube bombing produced a firestorm along with computer modelling citation needed have set one of the four physical conditions which a city fire must meet to have the potential of developing true firestorm effects as the size of the ube firestorm is the smallest ever confirmed glasstone and dolan the minimum requirements for a firestorm to develop no.4 a minimum burning area of about 0.5 square miles 1.3 km2 — glasstone and dolan 1977 37 atomic bombing of hiroshima in world war ii japan 6 august 1945 firestorm covering 4.4 square miles 11 km2 38 no estimate can be given of the number of fire deaths since the fire area was largely within the blast damage region 39 firebombing edit braunschweig burning after aerial firebombing attack in 1944 notice that a firestorm event has yet to develop in this picture as single isolated fires are seen burning and not the single large mass fire that is the identifying characteristic of a firestorm firebombing is a technique designed to damage a target generally an urban area through the use of fire caused by incendiary devices rather than from the blast effect of large bombs such raids often employ both incendiary devices and high explosives the high explosive destroys roofs making it easier for the incendiary devices to penetrate the structures and cause fires the high explosives also disrupt the ability of firefighters to douse the fires 20 although incendiary bombs have been used to destroy buildings since the start of gunpowder warfare world war ii saw the first use of strategic bombing from the air to destroy the ability of the enemy to wage war london coventry and many other british cities were firebombed during the blitz most large german cities were extensively firebombed starting in 1942 and almost all large japanese cities were firebombed during the last six months of world war ii as sir arthur harris the officer commanding raf bomber command from 1942 through to the end of the war in europe pointed out in his post-war analysis although many attempts were made to create deliberate man-made firestorms during world war ii few attempts succeeded the germans again and again missed their chance ..of setting our cities ablaze by a concentrated attack coventry was adequately concentrated in point of space but all the same there was little concentration in point of time and nothing like the fire tornadoes of hamburg or dresden ever occurred in this country but they did do us enough damage to teach us the principle of concentration the principle of starting so many fires at the same time that no fire fighting services however efficiently and quickly they were reinforced by the fire brigades of other towns could get them under control — arthur harris 20 according to physicist david hafemeister firestorms occurred after about 5 of all fire-bombing raids during world war ii but he does not explain if this is a percentage based on both allied and axis raids or combined allied raids or u.s. raids alone 40 in 2005 the american national fire protection association stated in a report that three major firestorms resulted from allied conventional bombing campaigns during world war ii hamburg dresden and tokyo 28 they do not include the comparatively minor firestorms at kassel darmstadt or even ube into their major firestorm category despite later quoting and corroborating glasstone and dolan and data collected from these smaller firestorms based on world war ii experience with mass fires resulting from air raids on germany and japan the minimum requirements for a firestorm to develop are considered by some authorities to be the following 1 at least 8 pounds of combustibles per square foot of fire area 40 kg per square meter 2 at least half of the structures in the area on fire simultaneously 3 a wind of less than 8 miles per hour at the time and 4 a minimum burning area of about half a square mile — glasstone and dolan 1977 41 21st century cities in comparison to world war ii cities edit a u.s air force table showing the total number of bombs dropped by the allies on germany s seven largest cities during the entirety of world war ii 42 city population in 1939 american tonnage british tonnage total tonnage berlin 4,339,000 22,090 45,517 67,607 hamburg 1,129,000 17,104 22,583 39,687 munich 841,000 11,471 7,858 19,329 cologne 772,000 10,211 34,712 44,923 leipzig 707,000 5,410 6,206 11,616 essen 667,000 1,518 36,420 37,938 dresden 642,000 4,441 2,659 7,100 unlike the highly combustible world war ii cities that firestormed from conventional and nuclear weapons fire experts suggest that due to the nature of modern u.s. city design and construction a firestorm is unlikely to occur even after a nuclear detonation 21 the explanation for this is that highrise buildings do not lend themselves to the formation of firestorms due to the baffle effect of the structures 1 nor are firestorms likely in areas where modern buildings have totally collapsed with the exceptions of tokyo and hiroshima due to the nature of their densely packed flimsy wooden buildings in world war ii 39 43 there is also a sizable difference between the fuel loading of world war ii cities that firestormed and that of modern cities where the quantity of combustibles per square meter in the fire area in the latter is below the necessary requirement for a firestorm to form 40 kg m² 44 45 therefore firestorms are not to be expected in modern u.s or canadian cities following a nuclear detonation nor are they expected to be likely in modern european cities 46 similarly one reason for the lack of success in creating a true firestorm in the bombing of berlin in world war ii was that the building density or builtupness factor in berlin was too low to support easy fire spread from building to building another reason was that much of the building construction was newer and better than in most of the old german city centers modern building practices in the berlin of world war ii led to more effective firewalls and fire-resistant construction mass firestorms never proved to be possible in berlin no matter how heavy the raid or what kinds of firebombs were dropped no true firestorm ever developed 47 nuclear weapons in comparison to conventional weapons edit the incendiary effects of a nuclear explosion do not present any especially characteristic features in principle the same overall result with respect to destruction of life and property can be achieved by the use of conventional incendiary and high-explosive bombs 48 it has been estimated for example that the same fire ferocity and damage produced at hiroshima by one 16-kiloton nuclear bomb from a single b-29 could have instead been produced by about 1,200 tons 1.2 kilotons of incendiary bombs from 220 b-29s distributed over the city 48 49 50 it may seem counterintuitive that the same amount of fire damage caused by a nuclear weapon could have instead been produced by smaller total yield of thousands of incendiary bombs however world war ii experience supports this assertion for example although not a perfect clone of the city of hiroshima in 1945 in the conventional bombing of dresden the combined royal air force raf and united states army air forces usaaf dropped a total of 3441.3 tons approximately 3.4 kilotons of ordnance about half of which was incendiary bombs on the night of 13–14 february 1945 and this resulted in more than 2.5 square miles 6.5 km2 of the city being destroyed by fire and firestorm effects according to one authoritative source 51 or approximately 8 square miles 21 km2 by another 23 in total about 4.5 kilotons of conventional ordnance was dropped on the city over a number of months during 1945 and this resulted in approximately 15 square miles 39 km2 of the city being destroyed by blast and fire effects 52 during the operation meetinghouse firebombing of tokyo on 9–10 march 1945 279 of the 334 b-29s dropped 1,665 tons of incendiary and high-explosive bombs on the city resulting in the destruction of over 10,000 acres of buildings — 16 square miles 41 km2 a quarter of the city 53 54 in contrast to these raids when a single 16-kiloton nuclear bomb was dropped on hiroshima 4.5 square miles 12 km2 of the city was destroyed by blast fire and firestorm effects 39 similarly major cortez f enloe a surgeon in the usaaf who worked with the united states strategic bombing survey ussbs said that the 22-kiloton nuclear bomb dropped on nagasaki did not do as much fire damage as the extended conventional airstrikes on hamburg 55 hiroshima after the bombing and firestorm no known aerial photography of the firestorm exists note the ambient wind blowing the fire s smoke plume inland the firebombing of tokyo on the night of 9–10 march 1945 was the single deadliest air raid of world war ii 56 with a greater total area of fire damage and loss of life than either nuclear bombing as a single event 53 54 due largely to the greater population density and fire conditions 279 b-29s dropped about 1,700 tons of ordnance on target 34 hiroshima aftermath despite a true firestorm developing reinforced concrete buildings as in tokyo similarly remained standing signed by the enola gay pilot paul w tibbets this tokyo residential section was virtually destroyed all that remained standing were concrete buildings in this photograph american historian gabriel kolko also echoed this sentiment during november 1944 american b-29 s began their first incendiary bomb raids on tokyo and on 9 march 1945 wave upon wave dropped masses of small incendiaries containing an early version of napalm on the city s population....soon small fires spread connected grew into a vast firestorm that sucked the oxygen out of the lower atmosphere the bomb raid was a success for the americans they killed 125,000 japanese in one attack the allies bombed hamburg and dresden in the same manner and nagoya osaka kobe and tokyo again on may 24....in fact the atomic bomb used against hiroshima was less lethal than massive fire bombing....only its technique was novel—nothing more....there was another difficulty posed by mass conventional bombing and that was its very success a success that made the two modes of human destruction qualitatively identical in fact and in the minds of the american military i was a little fearful secretary of war stimson told president truman that before we could get ready the air force might have japan so thoroughly bombed out that the new weapon would not have a fair background to show its strength to this the president laughed and said he understood 57 this break from the linear expectation of more fire damage to occur after greater explosive yield is dropped can be easily explained by two major factors first the order of blast and thermal events during a nuclear explosion is not ideal for the creation of fires in an incendiary bombing raid incendiary weapons followed after high-explosive blast weapons were dropped in a manner designed to create the greatest probability of fires from a limited quantity of explosive and incendiary weapons the so-called two-ton cookies 27 also known as blockbusters were dropped first and were intended to rupture water mains as well as to blow off roofs doors and windows creating an air flow that would feed the fires caused by the incendiaries that would then follow and be dropped ideally into holes created by the prior blast weapons such into attic and roof spaces 58 59 60 on the other hand nuclear weapons produce effects that are in the reverse order with thermal effects and flash occurring first which are then followed by the slower blast wave it is for this reason that conventional incendiary bombing raids are considered to be a great deal more efficient at causing mass fires than nuclear weapons of comparable yield it is likely this led the nuclear weapon effects experts franklin d olier samuel glasstone and philip j dolan to state that the same fire damage suffered at hiroshima could have instead been produced by about 1 kiloton 1,000 tons of incendiary bombs 48 49 the second factor explaining the non-intuitive break in the expected results of greater explosive yield producing greater city fire damage is that city fire damage is largely dependent not on the yield of the weapons used but on the conditions in and around the city itself with the fuel loading per square meter value of the city being one of the major factors a few hundred strategically placed incendiary devices would be sufficient to start a firestorm in a city if the conditions for a firestorm namely high fuel loading are already inherent to the city see bat bomb the great fire of london in 1666 although not forming a firestorm due to the single point of ignition serves as an example that given a densely packed and predominately wooden and thatch building construction in the urban area a mass fire is conceivable from the mere incendiary power of no more than a domestic fireplace on the other hand the largest nuclear weapon conceivable will be incapable of igniting a city into a firestorm if the city s properties namely its fuel density are not conducive to one developing despite the disadvantage of nuclear weapons when compared to conventional weapons of lower or comparable yield in terms of effectiveness at starting fires for the reasons discussed above nuclear weapons also do not add any fuel to a city and fires are entirely dependent on what was contained in the city prior to bombing in direct contrast to the incendiary device effect of conventional raids one undeniable advantage of nuclear weapons over conventional weapons when it comes to creating fires is that nuclear weapons undoubtedly produce all their thermal and explosive effects in a very short period of time that is to use arthur harris s terminology they are the epitome of an air raid guaranteed to be concentrated in point in time in contrast early in world war ii the ability to achieve conventional air raids concentrated in point of time depended largely upon the skill of pilots to remain in formation and their ability to hit the target whilst at times also being under heavy fire from anti-aircraft fire from the air defensives of the cities below nuclear weapons largely remove these uncertain variables therefore nuclear weapons reduce the question of whether a city will firestorm or not to a smaller number of variables to the point of becoming entirely reliant on the intrinsic properties of the city such as fuel loading and predictable atmospheric conditions such as wind speed in and around the city and less reliant on the unpredictable possibility of hundreds of bomber crews acting together successfully as a single unit

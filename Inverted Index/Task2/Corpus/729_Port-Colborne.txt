sir john colborne a british war hero and the lieutenant governor of upper canada at the time of the opening of the new southern terminus of the first welland canal in 1833 history edit in pre-colonial times the neutral indians lived in the area due in part to the ready availability of flint and chert from outcroppings on the onondaga escarpment 6 this advantage was diminished by the introduction of firearms by european traders and they were driven out by the iroquois around 1650 as part of the beaver wars originally called gravelly bay after the shallow bedrock-floored bay upon which it sits the modern city of port colborne traces its roots back to the united empire loyalist settlements that grew up in the area following the american revolution growth became focused around the southern terminus of the welland canal after it was extended to reach lake erie in 1833 as the population rose port colborne was incorporated as a village in 1870 became a town in 1918 merged with the

during the 1880s american tourists from the southern states began building vacation homes on the lakeshore of the western edge of the town before long an entire gated community of vacationers from the south called port colborne their home during the summer months 9 today the picturesque street of tennessee avenue is still home to many of these original vacation homes and buildings as well as the original stone and wrought iron resort gates the street boasts some immaculately maintained examples of late 19th and early 20th century southern architecture port colborne was one of the hardest hit communities during the blizzard of 1977 thousands of people were stranded when the city was paralyzed during the storm and the incident remains one of significance to the local population 10 economy edit maritime commerce including supplying goods to the camps for the labourers who worked on the first canal ship repair and the provisioning trade was and still is an important part of port colborne s economy like other cities in the region port colborne was a heavily industrial city throughout most of the early 20th century a grain elevator two modern flour mills 11 12 a vale nickel refinery 13 a cement plant operated by port colborne canada cement and a blast furnace operated by algoma steel were all major employers however several of these operations have closed over the past thirty years when while those companies that remain now employ significantly fewer residents due to modernization and cutbacks citation needed in more recent years when port colborne has been successful attracting new industry such as the agro-business operations of casco inc 14 and jungbunzlauer 15 which process corn into products such as sweeteners and citric acid however the economy has gradually shifted towards tourism and recreation taking advantage of the scenic beauty of the lakeshore citation needed the international nickel company now vale has long been one of the city s main employers since the opening of a refinery in 1918 taking advantage of inexpensive hydroelectricity from generating stations at nearby niagara falls the refinery produced electro-refined nickel for the war effort and grew to employ over 2,000 workers by the 1950s cutbacks in operations and increasing factory automation have reduced the workforce to its present-day total of 190 16 marine recycling corporation is a ship recycling firm located next to the welland canal at gravelly bay and operating since the 1970s environmental concerns edit emissions from inco s base metal refinery closed in 1984 resulted in soils contaminated with concentrations of nickel copper and cobalt above the ontario ministry of the environment s soil remediation criteria 17 however two studies one in 1997 and another in 1999 found no adverse health effects which may have resulted from environmental exposures 17 after a series of public meetings between the city the ministry of the environment moe and inco it was decided to perform a community-based risk assessment a process designed to determine whether the contamination poses a threat to the current past or future residents of port colborne and what inco must do to clean up the contaminated areas 18 some residents launched a class-action lawsuit against inco in 2001 19 20 seeking 750 million in damages to health property value and quality-of-life although this suit failed to be certified in 2002 21 22 it was subsequently modified to limit the class and focus solely on devaluation of property 23 and was certified on appeal on november 18 2005 24 25 a timeline of the case has been written from the point of view of the plaintiffs 26 on july 6 2010 the ontario supreme court sided with the residents and awarded more than 7,000 households in port colborne a total of 36 million households in the rodney street area in the shadow of the nickel refinery were each awarded 23,000 while those living on the east and west sides of port colborne were each awarded 9,000 and 2,500 respectively 27 vale appealed the ruling to the ontario court of appeal who found in 2010 that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence of economic harm raising the legal burden of proof but not invalidating rylands v fletcher as precedent law 28 29 30 in april 2012 the supreme court of canada sided with vale and denied the residents the awarded compensation 31 32 court costs in the amount of cad 1,766,000 were awarded the defendant by henderson j 26 climate edit climate data for port colborne 1981−2010 month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec year record high °c

hurricane and second major hurricane of the 1998 atlantic hurricane season it became the second most destructive storm of the season after hurricane mitch the costliest atlantic hurricane since hurricane andrew in 1992 and the deadliest since hurricane gordon in 1994 georges killed 604 people mainly on the island of hispaniola and caused extensive damage resulting at just under 10 billion

barbuda st kitts and nevis haiti the dominican republic cuba and the united states and puerto rico a territory of the united states—more than any other hurricane since hurricane inez of the 1966 season meteorological history edit main article meteorological history of hurricane georges map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave exited the coast of africa on september 13 moving westward the large system quickly developed a closed circulation and was classified tropical depression seven on september 15 a strong upper-level ridge forced the depression to the west-northwest where warm water temperatures allowed it to strengthen to a tropical storm on september 16 georges s circulation developed strong banding features around a well-organized central dense overcast and with the aid of a developing anti-cyclone georges attained hurricane status late on september 17 1 georges near the florida keys conditions became nearly ideal for continued development including warm water temperatures low-level inflow to the hurricane s north and good upper-level outflow a banding eye developed and georges reached major hurricane strength on september 19 while 675 mi 1085 km east-southeast of guadeloupe by september 19 an upper-level anticyclone was well established over georges and satellite pictures suggested that the hurricane was beginning to strengthen rapidly as indicated by the cooling cloud tops increased symmetry of the deep convection and the warming and contracting of the well-defined 40 mi 63 km wide eye as rapid intensification continued and georges peaked at a very dangerous category 4 storm with 155 mph 250 km h wind and a 937 minimal pressure late on september 19 and early september 20 at that time georges was the most intense strongest storm since hurricane hugo and alongside hurricane luis it is one of the largest major hurricanes in the atlantic with hurricane force windfields extending more than 150 mi 250 km from the center and with a more than 300 mi 490 km wide tropical storm force windfield shortly after peaking upper-level wind shear from the development of an upper-level low weakened the hurricane on september 20 in the afternoon as the central pressure had risen 26 mb as georges approached the leeward islands 1 on september 21 after weakening considerably category 3 georges made landfall directly on antigua and three hours later in st kitts though its 175  mi 280 km wide tropical storm force windfield affected all the leeward islands after weakening to a category 2 hurricane over the caribbean upper-level shear decreased and georges strengthened a bit before making landfall near fajardo puerto rico as a 115 mph 175 km h category 3 hurricane early in the morning over the mountainous terrain of the island the hurricane weakened again but over the mona passage it again re-intensified to hit eastern dominican republic with winds of 120 mph 195 km h on september 22 like in puerto rico georges was greatly weakened by the mountainous terrain and after crossing the windward passage it struck 30 mi 48 km east of guantánamo bay cuba on september 23 well-defined upper-level outflow allowed the hurricane to remain well organized and while paralleling the northern coastline of the island georges retained minimal hurricane status 1 hurricane georges reached the straits of florida on september 24 and as it had done earlier in its lifetime quickly restrengthened to category 2 status on the september 25 due to warm water temperatures and little upper-level shear it continued to the west-northwest and struck key west later on september 25 with winds of 105 mph 165 km h despite moving over warmer water georges only managed to peak at 110 mph 175 km h in the gulf of mexico likely due to its disrupted inner core a mid-tropospheric anticyclone pushed the hurricane slowly north-northwestward forcing georges to make its seventh and final landfall near biloxi mississippi on september 28 within 24 hours georges had weakened to a tropical depression and due to weak steering currents the storm looped over southern mississippi then drifted to the east the weak circulation moved eastward over the interior of the florida panhandle and dissipated on october 1 near the florida georgia border 1 preparations edit lesser antilles edit main

the american red cross deployed workers there with supplies for a potentially deadly event 4 5 due to initial forecasts of the hurricane brushing the northern portion of the country the dominican republic was caught off guard instead like in puerto rico georges traversed the entire country and passed close to santo domingo neighboring haiti expected the worst opening shelters and evacuating vulnerable people from low-lying coastal areas 6 prior to making landfall more than 200,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in eastern cuba in the potentially impacted area cuba s

livelihood insurance companies refused to insure some of the older shrimp boats leading shrimpers to ride it out with all they had left 8 due to lack of law enforcement those who stayed in key west went through red lights double-parked and disobeyed traffic laws long-time florida keys citizens noted the solitude of the time and enjoyed the island for how it once was rather than the large crowds of tourists 9 in the northern gulf of mexico georges was forecast to attain major hurricane status and make landfall in southeastern louisiana because of this portions of the state were evacuated including new orleans there the louisiana superdome was for the first time in its history used as a refuge of last resort for those unable to evacuate new orleans more than 14,000 citizens rode out the storm in the facility causing difficulties to supply necessities the building had no problems related to the weather though evacuees looted the building stole furniture and damaged property however the damage was much less than in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in 2005 many citizens in southern mississippi were told to leave due to a mandatory or recommended evacuation of those in the evacuation area 60 actually left most of those who stayed remained because they believed their house was safe enough for the storm of those who left most went to a relative s house in their own county 10 prior to making landfall georges s track was very uncertain this forced for the mandatory evacuations of alabama s two coastal counties baldwin and mobile counties with a combined population of over 500,000 people 11 despite the order only 67 of the area actually left to a safer place most of those who remained stayed because they believed their house would be able to withstand the hurricane the majority of those who did leave went to a relative s house in a safer portion of the state 10 in the days before making landfall only 22 of the population in recommended evacuation areas along the florida panhandle actually left however most of them were prepared to leave if the situation became worse those who did leave were concerned about the severity of the storm while those who stayed felt their home was safe enough for the hurricane s effects floridians who evacuated typically left for a friend or relative s house and only went to another area of their county 10 impact edit

damage most of the losses were confined to agriculture and livestock 26 fifty-five boats were sunk across the islands several power lines were downed throughout st croix by high winds leaving some residences without power 25 however compared to the intensity of georges during its passage of the islands relatively few people 15 of the island s customers lost power this was due to the improved power grid set up across the island for this type of event 27 total losses on the island were estimated at 2 million 1998 usd 28 in other nearby islands georges impact was relatively minor to moderate power outages flooding and minor to moderate structural damage was common 11 puerto rico edit main article effects of hurricane georges in puerto rico damage from mudslides georges was the first hurricane to cross the entire island of puerto rico since the san ciprian hurricane in 1932 29 the hurricane brought storm surge peaking at an estimated 10-ft 3 m in height in fajardo along with tides up to 20 ft 6 m above normal 1 30 the hurricane spawned two f2 tornadoes on the island though they caused little damage georges dropped immense precipitation in the mountain regions peaking at

isabela 1 the mountain flooding drained off in the island s rivers causing every river to overflow its banks near the coast the surfeit of water carved new channels from the record discharge rate the storm s strong winds caused beach erosion in many places along the coastline eroded beaches flooding and debris left many roads impassable or destroyed isolating some areas on the western portion of the island 29 georges s deluge of rainfall caused significant damage to the agricultural industry including the loss of 75 of its coffee crop 95 of its banana or plantain crop and 65 of its live poultry puerto rico damage its large circulation brought fierce winds to the entire island damaging 72,605 houses and destroying 28,005 others this left tens of thousands homeless after the storm s passage 1 over 22,000 people were sheltered in 139 shelters in cities throughout the island all shelters experienced power outages and after the storm passed through lack of water and sewer systems became a serious problem 10 high winds downed nearly half of the island s electric and telephone lines leaving 96 of the population powerless and 8.4 of telephone customers without service lack of electricity greatly damaged the water system resulting in the loss of water and sewer service for 75 of the island 29 in the nearby small island of culebra georges destroyed 74 houses and damaged 89 others although damage estimates are not available there 29 in all georges caused 3.6 billion in damage and there were no direct casualties due to well-executed warnings 1 however georges

downed and uprooted trees across much of the country littering streets with debris and mud thousands of houses were destroyed while many were completely destroyed from the flooding and winds the entire country was without electricity during the aftermath of the storm damaging water and communication systems 33 heavy wind damage and flooding caused extensive damage to the airport in santo domingo restricting usage to military and non-commercial flights 34 most impacted by hurricane georges was the agricultural industry the areas hardest hit by the hurricane coincided with the country s main crop-growing areas including the provinces around santo domingo after a severe drought in 1997 extreme rainfall damaged around 470,000 acres 190,202 ha of food crops including various types of vegetables fruits and roots — some of the country s main diet food substantial amounts of tobacco and sugar plantations the country s most important export crop were severely damaged the extreme flooding caused great losses in the poultry industry an important economy in the area the dominican republic had to import significant amounts of rice and other crops to compensate for the losses 35 death toll reports were slow in the wake of the storm but a total of 380 people died from hurricane georges 1 damage in the dominican republic amounted to 1.2 billion 1998 usd 1.8 billion 2009 usd 36

anticipated a rise in malnutrition disease homelessness and poverty 39 40 lack of electricity led to a total disruption of haiti s water supply system causing a decrease in sanitary conditions across the poorest country in the western hemisphere 41 in all 209 people died in haiti 1 like in the dominican republic the agricultural sector suffered extreme damage after a severe drought in 1997 georges s severe flooding stopped any chances of recovering quickly most of the country s significant crop land including artibonite valley suffered total losses up to 80 of banana plantations were lost while vegetable roots tubers and other food crops were ruined in addition thousands of small farm animals were either killed or lost 35 total agricultural losses amounted to 179 million 1998 usd 250 million

precipitation as well 1 storm surge of 4 – 6 feet 1 – 2 m was expected along the eastern coastline along with dangerous waves on top of the surge though winds were reduced by the time georges hit cuba it still retained winds of 75 mph 121 km h along with stronger gusts in squalls 43 the hurricane s heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides along the mountainous terrain this combined with strong winds damaged 60,475 homes of which 3,481 were completely destroyed 1 in the country 100,000 were left homeless due to hurricane georges 44 high winds downed power lines trees and telephone poles leaving many in eastern cuba without electricity in the aftermath of the storm along the coast severe flooding washed out railroad and highway bridges though eastern cuba was the area most affected the central and western portion of the island including havana experienced torrential rains and strong wind gusts 45 there strong waves broke over the seawall and caused heavy flood damage to some of the town s old buildings 46 like in puerto rico and hispaniola the severe drought during the el niño of 1997 exacerbated the flood s disruption to crops in eastern cuba the heavy rainfall from georges damaged the crops greatly despite the effort to harvest them prior to its arrival up to 70 of the plantain crop a chief food in the country s diet was destroyed the sugarcane crop fared badly as well limiting one of the country s important export crops the coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane further damaging the country s food supply 35 well-executed evacuations and warnings limited the death toll to six 1 while damage amounted to 305 million 1998 usd 500 million 2009 usd 14 bahamas edit though georges was forecast to move through the bahamas it passed to the

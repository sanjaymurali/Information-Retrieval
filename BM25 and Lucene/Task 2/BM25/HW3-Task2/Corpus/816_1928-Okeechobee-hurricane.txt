carolina united states east coast atlantic canada part of the 1928 atlantic hurricane season the okeechobee hurricane also known as the san felipe segundo hurricane was one of the deadliest hurricanes in the recorded history of the north atlantic basin the fourth tropical cyclone third hurricane and only major hurricane of the 1928 season this system developed just offshore the west coast of africa on september 6 initially a tropical depression it strengthened into a tropical storm later that day shortly before passing south of the cape verde islands further intensification was slow and halted by late on september 7 about 48 hours later the storm resumed strengthening and became a category 1 hurricane on the modern-day saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale still moving westward the system reached category 4 intensity before striking guadeloupe on september 12 there the storm brought great destruction and 1,200 deaths the islands of martinique montserrat and nevis also reported damage and fatalities but not nearly as severe as in guadeloupe around midday on september 13 the storm strengthened into a category 5 hurricane and peaked with sustained winds of 160 mph 260 km h about six hours later the system made landfall in puerto rico it remains the only recorded category 5 to strike the island as of 2017 very strong winds resulted in severe damage in puerto rico throughout the island an estimated 24,728 homes were destroyed and 192,444 were damaged leaving over 500,000 people homeless heavy rainfall also led to extreme damage to vegetation and agriculture on puerto rico alone there were 312 deaths and about 50 million usd 697 million today in damage while crossing the island and emerging into the atlantic the storm weakened slightly falling to category 4 intensity the storm began crossing through the bahamas on september 16 due to preparations minimal damage or loss of life occurred in the bahamas with 18 fatalities reported early on september 17 the storm made landfall near west palm beach florida with winds of 145 mph 233 km h in the city more than 1,711 homes were destroyed elsewhere in the county impact was most severe around lake okeechobee the storm surge caused water to pour out of the southern edge of the lake flooding hundreds of square miles as high as 20 feet 6.1 m above ground numerous houses and buildings were swept away in the cities of belle glade canal point chosen pahokee and south bay at least 2,500 people drowned while damage was estimated at 25 million while crossing florida the system weakened significantly falling to category 1 intensity late on september 17 it curved north-northeastward and briefly re-emerged into the atlantic on september 18 but soon made another landfall near edisto island south carolina with winds of 85 mph 140 km h early on the following day the system weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical over north carolina hours later overall the system caused 100 million in damage and at least 4,079 deaths meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on september 6 ships reported a tropical depression developing just off the west coast of africa near dakar senegal the next day a ship reported winds of 60 mph 95 km h or tropical storm status on this basis the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the system attained tropical storm status late on september 6 however lack of observations for several days prevented the system from being classified in real time as it moved generally westward across the atlantic ocean 1 on september 10 the s.s commack first observed the storm about 900 miles 1450 km to the east of guadeloupe which at the time was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship s radio later that day two other ships confirmed the intensity of the storm 2 and the hurricane research division estimated it strengthened into a hurricane at 18

18 30 utc on september 12 the hurricane s eye moved over guadeloupe with a barometric pressure of 940 millibars 28 inhg suggesting maximum sustained winds of 240 km h 140 mph or category 4 on the saffir–simpson scale 1 continuing to the west-northwest the hurricane passed about 10 mi 16 km south of saint croix before approaching puerto rico on september 13 the 15 mi 25 km eye crossed puerto rico in eight hours from the southeast to the northwest moving ashore near guayama and exiting between aguadilla and isabela 5 a ship near the southern coast reported a pressure of 931 mbar 27.5 inhg and the cup anemometer at san juan reported sustained winds of 160 mph 257 km h before failing 1 as the wind station was 30 miles 50 km north of the storm s center winds near the landfall point were unofficially estimated as high as 200 mph 320 km h 2 on this basis the hurricane is believed to have made landfall in puerto rico as a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale although there was uncertainty in the peak intensity due to the large size and slow movement of the storm 1 after emerging from puerto rico the hurricane had weakened to winds of about 140 mph 240 km h based on a pressure reading of 941 mbar 27.8 inhg at isabela the storm brushed the northern coast of hispaniola while moving west-northwestward gradually restrengthening on september 15 it passed within 35 mi 55 km of grand turk by which time the winds increased to 155 mph 250 km h the storm continued through the bahamas as a strong category 4 hurricane passing near nassau at 10 00 utc on september 16 1 initially richard gray of the u.s weather bureau was optimistic that the storm would spare south florida 6 however at 00 00 utc on september 17 the large hurricane made landfall in southeastern florida near west palm beach with estimated winds of 145 mph 230 km h this was based on a pressure reading of 929 mbar 27.4 inhg in the city 1 which at the time was the lowest pressure reading in the mainland united states this broke the previous record of 935 mbar 27.6 inhg set during the 1926 miami hurricane peak gusts were estimated near 160 mph 260 km h at canal point 2 the hurricane quickly weakened as it progressed inland and moved over lake okeechobee although the large size allowed it to maintain hurricane status for several more days late on september 17 the hurricane recurved to the northeast and passed near jacksonville early the next day with winds of 75 mph 120 km h at 08 00 utc on september 18 the storm once again reached open waters later that day the hurricane restrengthened slightly over open waters making a second united states landfall near edisto island south carolina at 19 00 utc with winds of 85 mph 140 km h accelerating northeastward the system quickly weakened into a tropical storm over north carolina on september 19 the storm evolved into an extratropical cyclone although it restrengthened slightly to hurricane status the cyclone turned to

south of the storm s path there were three fatalities guadeloupe received a direct hit from the storm apparently with little warning the death toll there was 1,200 10 and damage reports relayed through paris indicated great destruction on the island 2 about three-fourths of the island s residents were left homeless in the community of saint-françois the only structure to remain standing was the police station which was built with reinforced concrete to the east of the town the merchant ship albatros carrying 80 casks of rum sank the crew and the five men attempting to save the ship drowned 7 approximately 85 –95 of banana crops were destroyed 70 –80 of tree crops suffered severe damage and 40 of the sugar cane crop was ruined 11 montserrat just north of the storm s center was warned in advance of the storm but still suffered £150,000 1928 ukp in damages and 42 deaths plymouth and salem were devastated and crop losses caused near-starvation conditions before relief could arrive 8 all commercial and government buildings on the island were destroyed as were more than 600 homes saint kitts and nevis also suffered heavily on the island of st kitts a number of homes built on wooden foundations were demolished nine deaths were reported six of which occurred as a result of a schoolhouse collapse thirteen people were killed on the island of nevis 7 the storm destroyed hundreds of home on antigua including a doctor s home and a poor house government offices hospitals and school were also damaged on saint croix nearly all of the island s 11,000 residents suffered some degree of loss a total of 143 buildings were destroyed including a sugar mill the storm left nine deaths on the island throughout the virgin islands as many as 700,000 people were rendered homeless 7 puerto rico edit hurricane-force winds drove this 10-foot 3 m piece of 2x4 lumber through a palm tree in puerto rico while the storm was passing near dominica the san juan puerto rico weather bureau warned about the threat of the hurricane which would strike the island within a day or two the advisory was sent via telegraph to 75 police districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours 12 this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio 5 warnings were also posted for 12 ports along the southern coast causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312 and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of puerto rico by comparison the weaker 1899 san ciriaco hurricane killed approximately 3,000 people 12 according to the san juan national weather service office the storm was up to this time the greatest and more sic intense and destructive hurricane of record in puerto rico 5 along the storm path the eye passed over guayama cayey and aibonito resulting in a period of calm lasting 20 minutes 12 the island of puerto rico received the worst of the storm s winds when the hurricane moved directly across the island at category 5 strength 12 the hurricane was extremely large as it crossed puerto rico hurricane-force winds were measured in guayama for 18 hours since the storm is estimated to have been moving at 13 mph 21 km h the diameter of the storm s hurricane winds was estimated very roughly to be 234 miles 376 km 12 the storm was named the san felipe ii hurricane because the eye of the cyclone made landfall on the christian feast day of saint philip 13 it was named segundo spanish for the second because of another destructive san felipe hurricane which struck puerto rico on that same day in 1876 since european arrival in the americas in 1492 all storms and hurricanes were named after the name of the saint of the day the storm hit puerto rico in 1953 the united states started naming hurricanes by female names until 1978 when both gender names began to be used yet it was only in 1960 that hurricanes stopped being officially named after saints 13 the rainfall recorded on september 13–14 1928 remains the record for the maximum rainfall associated with a hurricane in puerto rico within a period of forty-eight hours in those regions where precipitation is more common place as in adjuntas in the cordillera central and in the sierra de luquillo the rain was over 25 inches 640 mm with 29.60 inches 752 mm recorded in adjuntas the anemometer located in puerta de tierra lost one of its cups at 11 44 am on september 13 just when it had registered a maximum speed of 150 miles 240 km per hour—a speed that was sustained for five consecutive minutes previously the same instrument had measured 160 miles 260 km per hour for one minute because these measurements were taken 30 miles 48 km from san felipe s eye at the time it seemed possible that some estimates of 200 miles 320 km per hour near the center of the storm were not overdrawn 13 there was general destruction through the island with the towns where the eye passed being swept away 13 property damage on the island from winds and rain was catastrophic the northeast portion of the island received winds in excess of category 3 strength with hurricane-force winds lasting as long as 18 hours official reports stated several hundred thousand people were left homeless and property damages were estimated at 50 million 12 14 on the island there was no building that was not affected some sugar mills centrales that had cost millions of dollars to build were reduced to rubble reports say that 24,728 homes were destroyed and 192,444 were partially destroyed 13 most of the sugarcane fields were flooded ruining the year s crops half of the coffee plants and half of the shade trees that covered these were destroyed almost all of the coffee harvest was lost the coffee industry would take years to recover since coffee needs shade trees to grow the tobacco farms also had great losses after this hurricane puerto rico never regained its position as a major coffee exporter 15 communications were impacted by fallen trees landslides and damaged bridges of the school buildings 770 were destroyed or damaged according to some estimates of the day excluding personal losses the damages reached 85.312 million and over 500,000 people were left homeless san felipe ii is officially classified as puerto rico s biggest worst and most devastating hurricane to

120 mph 193 km h according to a ship report in the region the force of the wind .. could only be judged by the noise made by the storm which reminded me of the new york subway going full speed passing

puerto rico authorities in the bahamas had ample warning of the hurricane s approach and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands two boats were wrecked as they washed ashore in grand turk although the crews were saved a sloop traversing from ambergris caye to grand turk was lost killing all 18 people on board 2 the storm caused heavy damage throughout the bahamas mostly to property and crops 1 in nassau some buildings which were recently repaired after the 1926 nassau hurricane were destroyed during this storm a 10-year-old girl drowned after falling into an open trench filled with water at the fort montague hotel the windows doors and furniture were badly damaged similar impact was reported at the royal victoria hotel while the british colonial hotel was largely spared however the gardens of the three hotels were damaged almost beyond recognition 7 on bimini sustained winds of 140 mph 230 km h were observed causing major damage to buildings ninety-five houses and some other buildings including a few churches and government buildings were damaged or destroyed on eleuthera minor damage was reported on rum cay most of the food crops were destroyed on san salvador island four buildings were demolished including two churches while several other structures suffered minor damage food crops were nearly wiped out 7 florida edit damage from the hurricane main article effects of the 1928 okeechobee hurricane in florida while the hurricane was moving through the bahamas the weather bureau issued storm warnings from miami to titusville later upgrading to a hurricane warning from miami to daytona beach the agency advised residents to take precautions for the hurricane citing the potential for strong winds and waves hurricane warnings were also posted for the west coast from punta rassa to apalachicola and after the storm recurved hurricane warnings were extended along the east coast to jacksonville 2 because of well-issued hurricane warnings residents were prepared for the storm and the number of lives lost in the coastal palm beach area was only 26 2 strong winds struck southern florida as the hurricane moved ashore with three unofficial reports of 100 mph 160 km h 2 in miami to the south of the center winds reached 78 mph 126 km h 1 and farther south key west reported winds of only 39 mph 63 km h the eye at landfall was 25 mi 40 km wide and after moving inland crossed lake okeechobee where a calm was reported for 30 minutes winds at canal point adjacent to the lake were estimated as high as 160 mph 255 km h the anemometer blew away after reporting sustained winds of 75 mph 120 km h the pressure at canal point dropped to 942 mbar 27.82 inhg the lowest pressure north of lake okeechobee was 966 mbar 28.54 inhg in bartow and along the west coast winds reached 31 mph 50 km h in tampa 2 the hurricane left thousands of people homeless in florida property damage was estimated at 25 million 349 million it is estimated if a similar storm were to strike as of the year 2003 it would cause 18.7 billion in damages the cyclone remains one of three atlantic hurricanes to strike the southern mainland of florida with a central pressure below 940 mbar 27.76 inhg the others being the 1926 miami hurricane and hurricane andrew of 1992 16 in addition to the human fatalities 1,278 livestock and 47,389 poultry were killed respectively 17 agriculture was impacted significantly with the storm destroying what may have been the largest citrus crop in the history of the industry approximately 6 of oranges and 18 of grapefruit were ruined respectively harvesting the remaining crops was delayed until mid-october due to inundated groves 7 communications also suffered severely throughout the state 32,000 households were left without telephone service and 400 poles were broken and about 2,500 others leaning 7 then-governor of florida john w martin estimated that 15,000 families were left homeless in palm beach county alone additionally about 11,500 families would need to be re-established 18 coastal south florida edit approximate area of the flood note the palm beach county label is misplaced north of canal

fairly minor 2 numerous power lines and telephone wires were downed in the latter 19 northward from pompano beach to jupiter buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and 10 ft 3 m storm surge 2 nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in deerfield beach while several citizens estimated that at least 50 of homes were demolished the town s post office depot and an entire business block were also destroyed an eight-year-old boy drowned in a ditch near where his family sought refuge in boca raton two garages and several houses were destroyed at the cloister inn windows were shattered and the roof was damaged across the street 32 freight cars belonging to a train along the florida east coast railway were tossed by the wind into a nearby ditch a short distance to the north a warehouse was flattened a building occupied by a restaurant and a store was flattened in delray beach four churches suffered severe damage and the alta repp and seacrest hotels both lost a portion of their roof the police reported three deaths within the city in delray beach and lantana all houses and the railroad station were badly damaged in boynton beach about 75 of businesses suffered complete destruction fifteen people were injured by a roof collapse while taking refuge in the auditorium of a high school 20 aftermath of the hurricane in southern florida in lake worth approximately 50 of homes were damaged or destroyed while 75 of buildings in the business district suffered damage 20 impact along the coast was most severe in palm beach total coastal damages were estimated as several million dollars 2 in west palm beach the storm destroyed 1,711 homes and damaged 6,369 others and demolished 268 businesses and impacted 490 other businesses the city suffered the worst damage totaling just under 13.8 million 18 likewise there was also severe wind damage in palm beach a few buildings constructed by henry flagler such as the breakers the royal poinciana hotel and whitehall were damaged mar-a-lago suffered little impact other than uprooted trees and the destruction of a large roman-style window according to marjorie merriweather post rodman wanamaker s house known as la guerida and later the winter white house during the presidency of john f kennedy suffered heavy damage during the storm 18 the alba billows new palm beach and royal daneli hotels all suffered water damage while the alba hotel was also deroofed nearby the rainbow pier only received structural damage to its railings though the pier office was blown away 21 approximately 600 structures including 10 hotels were damaged in palm beach damage totaled over 2 million 18 the strongest winds in the eyewall affected northern palm beach county particularly the vicinity of jupiter as the eye made landfall farther south 22 at the jupiter inlet lighthouse the mortar was reportedly squeezed .. like toothpaste between the bricks during the storm swaying the tower 17 in 430 mm off the base 23 the lighthouse keeper captain seabrook and his son franklin worked to keep the light on during the storm after the electricity went out after the generator failed to work they hand-cranked the light s mantle 24 the building formerly used as a weather bureau office was destroyed nearby six people died after a house was demolished six other fatalities occurred west of jupiter after a school where people sought shelter collapsed 7 lake okeechobee and everglades edit inland the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of lake okeechobee residents had been warned to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day but after the hurricane did not arrive on schedule many thought it had missed and returned to their homes in the weeks prior to storm heavy rainfall caused the lake to rise 3 ft 0.91 m between august 10 and september 10 and filled nearby canals and ditches precipitation from the hurricane itself caused lake okeechobee to rise further 23 when the worst of the storm crossed the lake the south-blowing wind caused a storm surge to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake the resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over 20 ft 6 m deep houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered 25 most survivors and bodies were washed out into the everglades where many of the bodies were never found 26 agricultural losses in the area surrounding lake okeechobee were also significant with virtually all crops destroyed and over 150 tractors suffering damage 7 storm total precipitation for september 15–19 1928 as the rear eyewall passed over the area the flood reversed itself breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing similar but smaller flooding 26 route 98 then known as conner s highway was closed until january when the bridge across the onosohatchee river at taylor creek was replaced after the original bridge was carried about 150 ft 46 m upstream during the storm 27 in okeechobee county homes along the lake were destroyed by the storm surge while dwellings within the city of okeechobee were severely impacted or demolished by winds of at least 90 mph 140 km h however brick and concrete-structured dwellings received little damage a number of three-story business buildings collapsed during the storm 28 almost all roads were left impassable while communications were nearly wiped out 29 overall 27 deaths occurred in okeechobee county along the southwestern shore of lake okeechobee the towns of clewiston and moore haven were both flooded but much of the damage to houses was due to strong winds 28 on kreamer island many residents received information about the storm when it was too late to evacuate in some homes 20–30 people sought shelter inside and later stood on tables and chairs to remain above the water most of the homes were swept away into rows of pine trees and others more than half a mile 0.8 km away despite this only one person drowned on the island residents of torry island also did not have ample time to prepare for the storm they attempted to evacuate but the causeway was already inundated forcing twenty-three people to seek refuge in a packinghouse floodwaters entered the building forcing the occupants into the rafters however the building was eventually pushed into a nearby canal ten people drowned but thirteen others survived by clinging to a barge or tree tops while one woman tied herself to a telegraph pole others that survived were swept far away from where the building once stood or the barge a teenage boy was carried from the packinghouse to the everglades experiment station in belle glade – a distance of about 8 mi 13 km 23 on ritta island a number who successfully climbed to the roof of their houses were struck by trees or received fatal bites from water moccasin 30 in south bay nearly all houses were destroyed and several buildings were unroofed at least 160 fatalities occurred in the city 18 the future first mayor of south bay aubrey a.k.a orb or a.o walker along with his brother haughty d walker a.k.a haught survived the great hurricane of 1928 by gathering family members and joining a number of other south bay citizens on a barge in the canal which allowed them to survive the flood waters that swept over south bay and ultimately engulfed okeelanta 31 throughout the 1920s okeelanta suffered several floods and muck fires finally the town was flooded severely during the storm and was subsequently abandoned 32 bean city was also destroyed during the hurricane but it was eventually rebuilt by arthur wells 33 sebring farms was reduced to piles of rubber with only four tall royal palm trees left standing 7 only the hotel at miami locks survived the storm 7 ninety-nine people died in that town 7 in chosen only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people twenty other residents took refuge in a building which lost its roof during the storm forcing the occupants to move into the restroom a house that was full of people floated about half a mile 0.8 km from its original location the refugees were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment 23 burial of victims in west palm beach floodwaters persisted for several weeks greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation burial services were quickly overwhelmed and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves around 75 of the fatalities were migrant farm workers making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult as a result of this the count of the dead is not very accurate the red cross estimated the number of fatalities as 1,836 which was taken as the official count by the national weather service for many years and exactly equal to the official count for hurricane katrina older sources usually list 3,411 as the hurricane s total count of fatalities including the caribbean however in 2003 the u.s death count was revised to at least 2,500 making the okeechobee hurricane the second-deadliest natural disaster in united states history behind the 1900 galveston hurricane a mass grave at the port mayaca cemetery east of port mayaca contains the bodies of 1,600 victims of the hurricane 26 central and north florida edit in fort myers property damage was slight limited mostly to scores of small boats and fishing shacks along the waterfront 34 nearly all cigar factories in tampa were closed after wind and rain drove too much moisture into the buildings 35 offshore the fishing smack wallace a mcdonnell was beached near piney point though all of the crew survived additionally the cuban schooner isabel alvado sank offshore boca grande the crew who were immigrants were rescued by the coast guard and later deported 36 in martin county a bridge connecting stuart and palm city was severely damaged and closed to traffic as a result a temporary ferry service across the st lucie river was established and operated until repairs to the bridge were complete in the summer of 1929 37 in fort pierce most of the impact was confined to the waterfront areas a warehouse fish houses docks and a bridge across the indian river were destroyed while several other buildings were unroofed damage in the city totaled about 150,000 18 in the interior areas of central and north florida impact was mainly confined to agricultural losses particularly citrus though wind damage occurred to structures between sebring and lake wales 200 telephone poles were toppled in bartow business building windows were shattered and signs were knocked down while several roofs and chimneys also suffered damage winds gusting up to 70 mph 110 km h lashed lakeland many trees were uprooted and several buildings were impacted including the hospital and a number of businesses at florida southern college fsc the north side of the gymnasium collapsed while other buildings on campus were damaged to a lesser degree the trees in the citrus grove surrounding fsc lost much of their fruit overall lakeland suffered about 50,000 in damage 38 in orlando impact to properties was described as slight 34 winds up to 50 mph 80 km h impacted the jacksonville area resulting in minor damage at jacksonville beach 39 elsewhere edit outside of florida damage in the united states was minor from the hurricane 2 in georgia low-lying streets were flooded or washed out in the savannah area additionally winds downed trees and power lines 1 heavy rainfall occurred from eastern florida through coastal georgia the carolinas and southeast virginia the highest rainfall total was 12.53 inches 318 mm at darlington south carolina 40 the storm caused flooding in north carolina and brought near-hurricane-force winds and a 7 foot 2.1 m storm surge to the norfolk area 41 after the hurricane became extratropical its wind

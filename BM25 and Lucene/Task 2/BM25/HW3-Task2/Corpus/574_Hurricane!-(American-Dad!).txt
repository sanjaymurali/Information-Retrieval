prepare to evacuate their home with their neighbor buckle in his amphibious raft stan however recommends that the family stay home during the storm believing it is the best way for everyone to be safe hayley and jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been left behind in the zoo francine disagrees with stan s notion steve and roger supporting her as she points out stan s history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations but before the debate can be resolved the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street removing buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the smiths in their home nevertheless the neighborhood is now flooded and while the smiths thinks it s too late to escape the house is drifting along the floodwater s current in an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas stan anchors the home however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down partially submerging it underwater roger cries when his girlfriend falls to the floor and gets impaled by a sharp object later the attic starts to fill it with water hayley tries to get the door shut but it s too strong to close off klaus now having the home being flooded can go whenever he wants and says see you never with the f-word being bombed he jumps out of the fishbowl into the water only to have his skin to burn due to salt water before hayley puts him back in the fishbowl the other family makes an rope out of curtins to get them out of the attic after removing stuff out of the door roger now missing his wigs until it s here picks up the wigs instead klaus that he still go to cowboy weddings leaving him behind franice tell the family to take one at the time as the rope is too weak unfortunately jeff was too panicked to wait he jumps on the rope witch ends up tearing it down angering hayley the family becomes increasingly frightened and distrustful of him especially when his latest advice leads hayley to be attacked by a shark with the shark loose in the house the family fights for survival stan loses hope and admits francine s suggestions are better than his own until klaus gives him an encouragement speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more stan obtains a bear from the zoo to battle the shark which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family refusing to accept francine s pleas to just get help stan instead throws a javelin that hits his wife in her shoulder instead of the bear buckle enters the house with a tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting stan who later tells buckle that he made the right call despite the whole ordeal stan is no longer convinced that he should stay out of a future crisis after the storm clears stan looks out to scope the damage done by the storm only to find himself in a stand-off with cleveland brown and peter griffin whose houses have ended up on both sides of the smiths house since the same hurricane hit their respective towns earlier when francine comes out the front door stan accidentally shoots her which peter claims to be classic american dad due to its unpredictability production edit see also night of the hurricane there were talks initially of doing a crossover with all the characters from all the shows but it became a little bit of a conundrum because you have three different staffs each of whom is used to writing three different sets of characters this idea of an outside force that sweeps its way through all three shows seemed like a cool way to accomplish that —seth macfarlane in an interview with the hollywood reporter 1 2 the episode was first announced in july 2010 by series creator seth macfarlane at the comic-con international in san diego california 3 4 kevin reilly the entertainment president of the fox broadcasting company originally pitched the idea for the crossover which was inspired by theme nights of comedy shows from the 1980s 1 5 macfarlane described the crossover event to be an enormous challenge and a substantial undertaking he chose to do one central story line so that each writing staff would not have to write stories for unfamiliar characters 1 he was also willing to do another crossover event if this one received successful ratings 1 much of the episode plot in hurricane was modeled after the action adventure disaster film the poseidon adventure 4 6 in his interview on the plot of the final part of the crossover episode mike barker a producer for american dad stated that they end up flooding the house and turning it upside down he continued ultimately the house drifts and ends up in the same neighborhood as the griffin and brown homes the actual crossing over of the event occurs at the end of this episode when stan gets involved in a stand off with cleveland brown of the cleveland show and peter griffin of family guy 6 in april 2011

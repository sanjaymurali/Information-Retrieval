has historically been home to a distinctive regional speech pattern called the new york dialect alternatively known as brooklynese or new yorkese it has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within american english 451 the classic version of this dialect is centered on middle and working-class people of european descent the influx of non-european immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect 452 and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general new yorkers as in the past 452 the traditional new york area accent is characterized as non-rhotic so that the sound ɹ does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant hence the pronunciation of the city name as new yawk 452 there is no ɹ in words like park pɑək or pɒək with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift butter bʌɾə or here hiə in another feature called the low back chain shift the ɔ vowel sound of words like talk law cross chocolate and coffee and the often homophonous ɔr in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in general american in the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the new york dialect the vowel sounds of words like girl and of words like oil became a diphthong ɜɪ this would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds so that girl is pronounced goil and oil is pronounced erl this leads to the caricature of new yorkers saying things like joizey jersey toidy-toid street 33rd st and terlet toilet 452 the character archie bunker from the 1970s sitcom all in the family played by carroll o connor was an example of having used this pattern of speech which continues to fade in its overall presence sports

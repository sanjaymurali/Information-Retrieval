28 storms tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration may have remained undetected because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable compensating for the lack of comprehensive observation one hurricane researcher estimates the season could have produced 24 tropical cyclones 1 of the 20 storms during the season 11 attained hurricane status six of those were major hurricanes with sustained winds of over 111 mph 179 km h two of the hurricanes reached winds of 160 mph 260 km h which is a category 5–the highest of 5– on the modern saffir-simpson hurricane scale nb 1 the season produced

on july 11 over panama and also quickly dissipated a tropical depression developed on july 17 in the northeastern atlantic west of the azores and one ship reported hurricane-force winds however there was little evidence that the tropical system was organized so it was not classified as a tropical storm originally there was a tropical storm in the database in the caribbean in the middle of august but it was downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force winds similarly there was a tropical storm in the database in late september but it was also downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of gale-force winds 5 the season produced the highest accumulated cyclone energy ace on record with a total of 259 the measurement is a method to compare tropical cyclone activity between seasons originally 1933 had an ace of 213 7 which was surpassed by 1950 and 2005 8 however the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project found that the storms in 1933 were

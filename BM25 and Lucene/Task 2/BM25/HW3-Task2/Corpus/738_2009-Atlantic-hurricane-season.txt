atlantic hurricane season that produced eleven tropical cyclones nine named storms three hurricanes and two major hurricanes 1 nb 1 it officially began on june 1 and ended on november 30 dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the atlantic basin 3 the season s first tropical cyclone tropical depression one developed on may 28 4 while the final storm hurricane ida dissipated on november 10 5 the most intense hurricane bill was a powerful cape verde-type hurricane that affected areas from the leeward islands to newfoundland 6 the season featured the lowest number of tropical cyclones since the 1997 season and only one system claudette made landfall in the united states forming from the interaction of a tropical wave and an upper level low claudette made landfall on the florida panhandle with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph 75 km h before quickly dissipating over alabama the storm killed two people and caused 228,000 2009 usd in damage pre-season forecasts issued by colorado state university csu called for fourteen named storms and seven hurricanes of which three were expected to attain major hurricane status nb 2 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa later issued its initial forecast which predicted nine to fourteen named storms four to seven hurricanes and one to three major hurricanes after several revisions in the projected number of named storms both agencies lowered their forecasts by the middle of the season several storms made landfall or directly affected land outside of the united states tropical storm ana brought substantial rainfall totals to many of the caribbean islands including puerto rico which led to minor street flooding hurricane bill delivered gusty winds and rain to the island of newfoundland while tropical storm danny affected the u.s state of north carolina and erika affected the lesser antilles as a poorly organized tropical system hurricane fred affected the cape verde islands as a developing tropical cyclone and tropical storm grace briefly impacted the azores becoming the farthest northeast forming storm on record the season s final storm ida affected

the 2009 season nine of the eleven tropical cyclones affected land of which five actually made landfall the united states experienced one of its quietest years with no hurricanes making landfall in the country throughout the basin six people were killed in tropical cyclone-related incidents and total losses reached roughly 77 million most of the damage resulted from hurricane bill which caused severe beach erosion throughout the east coast of the united states in the united states tropical cyclones killed six people and caused roughly 50 million in damage in the lesser antilles tropical storms ana and erika brought moderate rainfall to several islands but resulted in little damage elsewhere in the atlantic the azores islands atlantic canada bermuda cape verde islands and wales were affected by tropical cyclones or their remnants 1 in canada hurricane bill produced widespread moderate rainfall in nova scotia and newfoundland leaving roughly 10 million in losses 14 the hurricane also produced tropical storm-force winds in bermuda 6 hurricane fred briefly impacted the southern cape verde islands as it bypassed the islands early in its existence 15 the azores and wales were also affected by tropical storm grace however both areas recorded only minor effects 16 overall the season s activity was reflected with a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 53 the lowest since 1997 17 due to the low number of storms in the 2009 season many of which were short-lived the overall ace value was ranked as below-average totaling under 66 18 hurricane bill was responsible for the ace value for august being 30 above average 19 ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength

a small area over the low pressure system leading to the national hurricane center classifying the system as tropical depression one the depression moved over the warm waters of the gulf stream for the following 24 hours allowing it to maintain its convection before moving into a hostile environment characterized by strong wind shear and cooler waters late on may 29 the system degenerated into a remnant low several hours later on may 30 about 345 mi 555 km south-southeast of halifax nova scotia tropical depression one was absorbed by a warm front 4 as a tropical cyclone the depression had no impact on land however the precursor to the system brought scattered rainfall and increased winds to parts of the north carolina coastline but no damage 4 upon becoming a tropical depression on may 28

1,735 km east of the leeward islands early on august 15 the storm re-attained tropical storm status at which time it was named ana after reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40 mph 65 km h and a barometric pressure of 1003 mbar hpa 29.65 inhg the storm began to weaken again due to increasing wind shear and the unusually fast movement of ana in post-storm analysis it was discovered that ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on august 16 before reaching any landmasses 22 numerous tropical storm watches were issued for the lesser antilles puerto rico and the dominican republic between august 15 and 17 22 several islands took minor precautions for the storm including st croix which evacuated 40 residents from flood-prone areas ahead of the storm 23 in the dominican republic officials took preparations by setting up relief agencies and setting up shelters 24 impact from ana was minimal mainly consisting of light to moderate rainfall 22 in puerto rico up to 2.76 in 70 mm

category 4 storm roughly 345 mi 555 km east-northeast of the leeward islands the storm attained maximum winds of 130 mph 215 km h the highest of any storm during the season before weakening slightly as it turned north the large storm passed roughly 175 mi 280 km west of bermuda as a category 2 hurricane further weakening took place as bill brushed the southern coast of nova scotia the following day shortly before making landfall in newfoundland bill weakened to a tropical storm and accelerated the storm eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after moving over the north atlantic before being absorbed by a larger non-tropical low on august 24 6 two people were killed by the storm s large swells—one in maine and another in florida the hurricane came close enough to warrant tropical cyclone watches and warnings in both the us and canada bill was one of three tropical storms active on august 16 6 large life-threatening swells produced by the storm impacted

counties were advised to evacuate storm-surge-prone areas 30 31 tropical storm claudette produced moderate rainfall across portions of florida georgia and alabama between august 16 and 18 two people

depression as it turned northward on november 7 the depression re-entered the caribbean sea and quickly intensified early on november 8 the system re-attained hurricane intensity as it rapidly intensified over warm waters ida attained its peak intensity as a category 2 hurricane early the next day with winds of 105 mph 165 km h as it moved over the yucatán channel not long after reaching this intensity ida quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it entered the gulf of mexico despite strong wind shear the storm briefly re-attained hurricane status for a third time near the southeastern louisiana coastline before quickly weakening to a tropical storm shortly before moving inland over the southern united states ida transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the remnants of ida persisted until november 11 at which time the low dissipated remnant energy from ida provided energy for another system which became a powerful nor easter causing significant damage in the mid-atlantic states the resulting storm came to be known as nor ida 5 in the southern caribbean hurricane ida caused roughly 2.1 million in damage in nicaragua after destroying numerous homes and leaving an estimated 40,000 people homeless 46 47 ida also produced significant rainfall across portions of western cuba with some areas recording up to 12.5 in 320 mm of rain during the storm s passage 5 in the united states the hurricane and the subsequent nor easter caused substantial damage mainly in the mid-atlantic states 5 one person was killed by ida after drowning in rough seas while six others were killed in various incidents related to the nor easter overall the two systems caused nearly 300 million in damage throughout the country 33 storm names edit the following names were

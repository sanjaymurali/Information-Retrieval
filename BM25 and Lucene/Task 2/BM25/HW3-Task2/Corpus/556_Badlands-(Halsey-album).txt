known as the badlands the city is surrounded by a desert wasteland keeping the inhabitants of the badlands captive 9 the album was inspired by post-apocalyptic movies such as the fifth element after writing the first few songs halsey came to the realization that the entire concept was a metaphor for her mental state halsey states that she created the badlands as an escape from her real life struggles in her opinion the metaphor was that even with no escape there is still optimism that there is somewhere else to go 9 the album was executive produced by lido 10 singles edit ghost was

in belgium ultratop flanders in a review for pitchfork nathan reese wrote reading interviews with halsey you get the sense of a canny and talented performer one who legitimately wants to connect with fans but the public persona only comes through on badlands in fits and starts and there isn t a single subversive or original second on the album about the chorus on new americana he commented like most of badlands it s calculated defiant and ultimately hollow 20 in a short review rolling stone s joe levy called halsey a new popstar with a knack for sticky imagery 21 the album was included at number six on rock sound s top 50 releases of 2015 list 27 track listing edit badlands – standard edition 28 no title writer s producer s length 1 castle ashley frangipane peder losnegård lido 4 37 2

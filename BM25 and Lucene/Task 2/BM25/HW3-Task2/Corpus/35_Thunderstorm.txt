thunderstorm also known as an electrical storm lightning storm or thundershower is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the earth s atmosphere known as thunder 1 thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus they are usually accompanied by strong winds heavy rain and sometimes snow sleet hail or in contrast no precipitation at all thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband known as a squall line strong or severe thunderstorms known as supercells rotate as do cyclones while most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction warm moist updraft from a thunderstorm associated with a southward-moving frontal boundary – taken from texarkana texas looking north thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm moist air sometimes along a front as the warm moist air moves upward it cools condenses and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over 20 kilometres 12 mi as the rising air reaches its dew point temperature water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the earth s surface as the droplets fall they collide with other droplets and become larger the falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it and this cold air spreads out at the earth s surface occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude where warm moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes 2 thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena thunderstorms and the phenomena that occur along with them pose great hazards damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds large hailstones and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts there are four types of thunderstorms single-cell multi-cell cluster multi-cell lines and supercells supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes dry thunderstorms with no precipitation can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them several means are used to study thunderstorms weather radar weather stations and video photography past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century beyond the earth s atmosphere thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of jupiter saturn neptune and probably venus life cycle stages of a thunderstorm s life see also cloud warm air has a lower density than cool air so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the bottom 3 this effect can be seen with a hot air balloon 4 clouds form as relatively warmer air carrying moisture rises within cooler air the moist air rises and as it does so it cools and some of the water vapor in that rising air condenses 5 when the moisture condenses it releases energy known as latent heat of vaporization which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than the cooler surrounding air 6 continuing the cloud s ascension if enough instability is present in the atmosphere this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form and produce lightning and thunder meteorological indices such as convective available potential energy cape and the lifted index can be used to assist in determining potential upward vertical development of clouds 7 generally thunderstorms require three conditions to form moisture an unstable airmass a lifting force heat all thunderstorms regardless of type go through three stages the developing stage the mature stage and the dissipation stage 8 the average thunderstorm has a 24 km 15 mi diameter depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere each of these three stages take an average of 30 minutes 9 cumulus stage the first stage of a thunderstorm is the cumulus stage or developing stage during this stage masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere the trigger for this lift can be solar illumination where the heating of the ground produces thermals or where two winds converge forcing air upwards or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation the moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude which appear as cumulus clouds as the water vapor condenses into liquid latent heat is released which warms the air causing it to become less dense than the surrounding drier air the air tends to rise in an updraft through the process of convection hence the term convective precipitation this process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm in a typical thunderstorm approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the earth s atmosphere 10 mature stage anvil-shaped thundercloud in the mature stage over swifts creek victoria in the mature stage of a thunderstorm the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther often this cap is the tropopause the air is instead forced to spread out giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape the resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus the water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles as these fall they melt to become rain if the updraft is strong enough the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as hail while updrafts are still present the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it creating downdrafts as well the simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds during this stage considerable internal turbulence can occur within which manifests as strong winds severe lightning and even tornadoes 11 typically if there is little wind shear the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and rain itself out 8 but if there is sufficient change in wind speed and or direction the downdraft will be separated from the updraft and the storm may become a supercell where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours 12 dissipating stage a thunderstorm in an environment with no winds to shear the storm or blow the anvil in any one direction in the dissipation stage the thunderstorm is dominated by the downdraft if atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development this stage occurs rather quickly approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm the downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm hit the ground and spread out this phenomenon is known as a downburst the cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm moist air and kills the thunderstorm s further growth 13 the downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary this can cause downbursts a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft the stronger the outflow boundary is the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes 14 classification conditions favorable for thunderstorm types and complexes there are four main types of thunderstorms single-cell multi-cell squall line also called multi-cell line and supercell which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere wind shear single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20–30 minutes organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear normally greater than 25 knots 13 m s in the lowest 6 kilometres 3.7 mi of the troposphere 15 which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather the supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms most commonly associated with large hail high winds and tornado formation precipitable water values of greater than 31.8 millimetres 1.25 in favor the development of organized thunderstorm complexes 16 those with heavy rainfall normally have precipitable water values greater than 36.9 millimetres 1.45 in 17 upstream values of cape of greater than 800 j kg are usually required for the development of organized convection 18 single-cell main article air-mass thunderstorm a single-cell thunderstorm over wagga wagga this term technically applies to a single thunderstorm with one main updraft also known as air-mass thunderstorms these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales they also occur in the cool unstable air that often follows the passage of a cold front from the sea during winter within a cluster of thunderstorms the term cell refers to each separate principal updraft thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary that sets up new thunderstorm development such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability hence the term air mass thunderstorm when such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them it is known as a pulse severe storm pulse severe storms are poorly organized and occur randomly in time and space making them difficult to forecast single-cell thunderstorms normally last 20–30 minutes 9 multi-cell clusters main article multicellular thunderstorm a group of thunderstorms over brazil photographed by the space shuttle challenger this is the most common type of thunderstorm development mature thunderstorms are found near the center of the cluster while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines while each cell of the cluster may only last 20 minutes the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time they often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure these type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm yet much weaker than the supercell storm hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail flash flooding and weak tornadoes 9 multicell lines main article squall line see also list of derecho events a squall line is an elongated line of severe thunderstorms that can form along and or ahead of a cold front 19 20 in the early 20th century the term was used as a synonym for cold front 21 the squall line contains heavy precipitation hail frequent lightning strong straight line winds and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts 22 severe weather in the form of strong straight-line winds can be expected in areas where the squall line itself is in the shape of a bow echo within the portion of the line that bows out the most 23 tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern or lewp where mesoscale low pressure areas are present 24 some bow echoes in the summer are called derechos and move quite fast through large sections of territory 25 on the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines a wake low can form which is a mesoscale low pressure area that forms behind the mesoscale high pressure system normally present under the rain canopy which are sometimes associated with a heat burst 26 this kind of storm is also known as wind of the stony lake traditional chinese 石湖風 – shi2 hu2 feng1 simplified chinese 石湖风 in southern china 27 supercells main article supercell a supercell thunderstorm over chaparral new mexico the setting sun illuminates the top of a classic anvil-shaped thunderstorm cloud in eastern nebraska united states supercell storms are large usually severe quasi-steady-state storms that form in an environment where wind speed or wind direction varies with height wind shear and they have separate downdrafts and updrafts i.e. where its associated precipitation is not falling through the updraft with a strong rotating updraft a mesocyclone these storms normally have such powerful updrafts that the top of the supercell storm cloud or anvil can break through the troposphere and reach into the lower levels of the stratosphere and supercell storms can be 24 kilometres 15 mi wide research has shown that at least 90 percent of supercells cause severe weather 12 these storms can produce destructive tornadoes sometimes f3 or higher extremely large hailstones 10 centimetres or 4 inches diameter straight-line winds in excess of 130 km h 81 mph and flash floods in fact research has also shown that most tornadoes occur from this type of thunderstorm 28 supercells are the strongest type of thunderstorm even stronger than the most severe thunderstorms 9 severe thunderstorms a thunderstorm is classed as severe if winds reach at least 93 kilometres per hour 58 mph hail is 25 millimetres 1 in in diameter or larger or if funnel clouds or tornadoes are reported 29 30 31 although a funnel cloud or tornado indicates a severe thunderstorm a tornado warning is issued in place of a severe thunderstorm warning a severe thunderstorm warning is issued if a thunderstorm becomes severe or will soon turn severe in canada a rainfall rate greater than 50 millimetres 2 in in one hour or 75 millimetres 3 in in three hours is also used to indicate severe thunderstorms 32 severe thunderstorms can occur from any type of storm cell however multicell supercell and squall lines represent the most common forms of thunderstorms that produce severe weather 12 mesoscale convective systems see also mesoscale convective system mcc moving through new england august 2 2006 0600 utc a mesoscale convective system mcs is a complex of thunderstorms that becomes organized on a scale larger than the individual thunderstorms but smaller than extratropical cyclones and normally persists for several hours or more 33 a mesoscale convective system s overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones squall lines lake-effect snow events polar lows and mesoscale convective complexes mccs and they generally form near weather fronts most mesoscale convective systems develop overnight and continue their lifespan through the next day 8 the type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across north america europe and asia with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening hours 34 35 forms of mcs that develop in the tropics are found in use either the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon troughs generally within the warm season between spring and fall more intense systems form over land than over water 36 37 one exception is that of lake-effect snow bands which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water and occurs from fall through spring 38 polar lows are a second special class of mcs they form at high latitudes during the cold season 39 once the parent mcs dies later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex mcv 40 mesoscale convective systems are important to the united states rainfall climatology over the great plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall 41 motion thunderstorm line viewed in reflectivity dbz on a plan position indicator radar display the two major ways thunderstorms move are via advection of the wind and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the earth s troposphere the lowest 8 kilometres 5.0 mi of the earth s atmosphere weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the earth s surface than stronger thunderstorms as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall organized long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector if the gust front or leading edge of the outflow boundary races ahead of the thunderstorm its motion will accelerate in tandem this is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation hp than with thunderstorms with low precipitation lp when thunderstorms merge which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell the stronger the mean wind the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion on weather radar storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan 12 back-building thunderstorm a back-building thunderstorm commonly referred to as a training thunderstorm is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side usually the west or southwest side in the northern hemisphere such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction though the storm often appears stationary on radar or even moving upwind this is an illusion the storm is really a multi-cell storm with new more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind 42 43 when this happens catastrophic flooding is possible in rapid city south dakota in 1972 an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area resulting in devastating flash flooding 44 a similar event occurred in boscastle england on 16 august 2004 45 hazards each year many people are killed or seriously injured by severe thunderstorms despite the advance warning while severe thunderstorms are most common in the spring and summer they can occur at just about any time of the year cloud-to-ground lightning see also lightning and wildfire a return stroke cloud-to-ground lightning strike during a thunderstorm cloud-to-ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations one of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting 46 under a regime of low precipitation lp thunderstorms where little precipitation is present rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat 47 direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion 48 in areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground lightning like florida lightning causes several fatalities per year most commonly to people working outside 49 acid rain is also a frequent risk produced by lightning distilled water has a neutral ph of 7 “clean” or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic ph of about 5.2 because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid a weak acid ph 5.6 in distilled water but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals 50 nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena 51 caused by the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen can result in the production of acid rain if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation thus creating acid rain acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or certain other solid chemical compounds in ecosystems acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms 52 hail main article hail hailstorm in bogotá colombia any thunderstorm that produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm 53 thunderclouds that are capable of producing hailstones are often seen obtaining green coloration hail is more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards known as orographic lifting thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely 54 one of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern india which reported one of the highest hail-related death tolls on record in 1888 55 china also experiences significant hailstorms 56 across europe croatia experiences frequent occurrences of hail 57 in north america hail is most common in the area where colorado nebraska and wyoming meet known as hail alley 58 hail in this region occurs between the months of march and october during the afternoon and evening hours with the bulk of the occurrences from may through september cheyenne wyoming is north america s most hail-prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season 59 in south america areas prone to hail are cities like bogotá colombia hail can cause serious damage notably to automobiles aircraft skylights glass-roofed structures livestock and most commonly farmers crops 59 hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft when hail stones exceed 13 millimetres 0.5 in in diameter planes can be seriously damaged within seconds 60 the hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft wheat corn soybeans and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage 55 hail is one of canada s most costly hazards 61 hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history one of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th century in roopkund uttarakhand india 62 the largest hailstone in terms of maximum circumference and length ever recorded in the united states fell in 2003 in aurora nebraska united states 63 tornadoes and waterspouts in june 2007 the town of elie manitoba was struck by an f5 tornado main articles tornado and waterspout a tornado is a violent rotating column of air in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud otherwise known as a thundercloud or in rare cases the base of a cumulus cloud tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust 64 most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 and 110 mph 64 and 177 km h are approximately 75 metres 246 ft across and travel several kilometers a few miles before dissipating some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph 480 km h stretch more than 1,600 metres 1 mi across and stay on the ground for more than 100 kilometres dozens of miles 65 66 67 the fujita scale and the enhanced fujita scale rate tornadoes by damage caused an ef0 tornado the weakest category damages trees but not substantial structures an ef5 tornado the strongest category rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers the similar torro scale ranges from a t0 for extremely weak tornadoes to t11 for the most powerful known tornadoes 68 doppler radar data photogrammetry and ground swirl patterns cycloidal marks may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating 69 formation of numerous waterspouts in the great lakes region north america a flash flood caused by a severe thunderstorm waterspouts have similar characteristics as tornadoes characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current that form over bodies of water connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes or more specifically non-supercelled tornadoes that develop over large bodies of water 70 these spiralling columns of air are frequently developed within tropical areas close to the equator but are less common within areas of high latitude 71 flash flood main article flash flood flash flooding is the process where a landscape most notably an urban environment is subjected to rapid floods 72 these rapid floods occur more quickly and are more localized than seasonal river flooding or areal flooding 73 and are frequently though not always associated with intense rainfall 74 flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and is usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it flash floods are most common in densely populated urban environments where few plants and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure such as bridges and weakly constructed buildings plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced soil erosion can occur as well exposing risks of landslide phenomena downburst main article downburst trees uprooted or displaced by the force of a downburst wind in northwest monroe county wisconsin downburst winds can produce numerous hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms downburst winds are generally very powerful and are often mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes 75 due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable incomplete or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings agricultural crops and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash 8 75 automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it due to their higher density when these downdrafts reach the surface they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds 8 thunderstorm asthma main article thunderstorm asthma thunderstorm asthma is the triggering of an asthma attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local thunderstorm during a thunderstorm pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind while larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs triggering the asthma attack 76 77 78 79 safety precautions see also emergency management and tornado preparedness most thunderstorms come and go fairly uneventfully however any thunderstorm can become severe and all thunderstorms by definition present the danger of lightning 80 thunderstorm preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before during and after a thunderstorm to minimize injury and damage preparedness preparedness refers to precautions that should be taken before a thunderstorm some preparedness takes the form of general readiness as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year 81 preparing a family emergency plan for example can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly 82 preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees which can be blown over in high winds can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury 83 the national weather service nws in the united states recommends several precautions that people should take if thunderstorms are likely to occur 81 know the names of local counties cities and towns as these are how warnings are described 81 monitor forecasts and weather conditions and know whether thunderstorms are likely in the area 84 be alert for natural signs of an approaching storm cancel or reschedule outdoor events to avoid being caught outdoors when a storm hits 84 take action early so you have time to get to a safe place 84 get inside a substantial building or hard-topped metal vehicle before threatening weather arrives 84 if you hear thunder get to the safe place immediately 84 avoid open areas like hilltops fields and beaches and don t be or be near the tallest objects in an area when thunderstorms are occurring 81 84 don t shelter under tall or isolated trees during thunderstorms 84 if in the woods put as much distance between you and any trees during thunderstorms 84 if in a group spread out so that you increase the chances for survivors who could come to the aid of any victims from a lightning strike 84 safety while safety and preparedness often overlap “thunderstorm safety” generally refers to what people should do during and after a storm the american red cross recommends that people follow these precautions if a storm is imminent or in progress 80 take action immediately upon hearing thunder anyone close enough to the storm to hear thunder can be struck by lightning 83 avoid electrical appliances including corded telephones 80 cordless and wireless telephones are safe to use during a thunderstorm 83 close and stay away from windows and doors as glass can become a serious hazard in high wind 80 do not bathe or shower as plumbing conducts electricity if driving safely exit the roadway turn on hazard lights and park remain in the vehicle and avoid touching metal 80 the nws stopped recommending the lightning crouch in 2008 as it doesn t provide a significant level of protection and will not significantly lower the risk of being killed or injured from a nearby lightning strike 84 85 86 frequent occurrences see also united states rainfall climatology a mild thunderstorm over niagara falls ontario thunderstorms occur throughout the world even in the polar regions with the greatest frequency in tropical rainforest areas where they may occur nearly daily at any given time approximately 2,000 thunderstorms are occurring on earth 87 kampala and tororo in uganda have each been mentioned as the most thunderous places on earth 88 a claim also made for singapore and bogor on the indonesian island of java other cities known for frequent storm activity include darwin caracas manila and mumbai thunderstorms are associated with the various monsoon seasons around the globe and they populate the rainbands of tropical cyclones 89 in temperate regions they are most frequent in spring and summer although they can occur along or ahead of cold fronts at any time of year 90 they may also occur within a cooler air mass following the passage of a cold front over a relatively warmer body of water thunderstorms are rare in polar regions because of cold surface temperatures some of the most powerful thunderstorms over the united states occur in the midwest and the southern states these storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the west coast of the united states 91 but they occur with greater frequency in the inland areas particularly the sacramento and san joaquin valleys of california in spring and summer they occur nearly daily in certain areas of the rocky mountains as part of the north american monsoon regime in the northeast storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the midwest but with less frequency and severity during the summer air-mass thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of florida types of lightning play media 3-second video of a lightning strike within a thunderstorm over island in the sky canyonlands national park utah cloud to ground lightning over pentagon city in arlington virginia lightning storm over sydney main article lightning lightning is an electrical discharge that occurs in a thunderstorm it can be seen in the form of a bright streak or bolt from the sky lightning occurs when an electrical charge is built up within a cloud due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level when a large enough charge is built up a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning the temperature of a lightning bolt can be five times hotter than the surface of the sun 92 although the lightning is extremely hot the duration is short and 90 of strike victims survive contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot some people have been struck by lightning over three times and skyscrapers like the empire state building have been struck numerous times in the same storm 93 the loud bang that is heard is the super heated air around the lightning bolt expanding at the speed of sound because sound travels much more slowly than light the flash is seen before the bang although both occur at the same moment there are several types of lightning in-cloud lightning is the most common it is lightning within a cloud and is sometimes called intra-cloud or sheet lightning cloud to ground lightning is when a bolt of lightning from a cloud strikes the ground this form poses the greatest threat to life and property ground to cloud lightning is when a lightning bolt is induced from the ground to the cloud cloud to cloud lightning is rarely seen and is when a bolt of lightning arcs from one cloud to another ball lightning is extremely rare and has several hypothesized explanations it is seen in the form of a 15 to 50 centimeter radius ball 94 cloud to air lightning is when lightning from a cloud hits air of a different charge 95 dry lightning is a misnomer that refers to a thunderstorm whose precipitation does not reach the ground heat lightning refers to a lightning flash that is seen from the horizon that does not have accompanying thunder 96 upper-atmospheric lightning occurs above the thunderhead clear-air lightning is used widely to describe lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it in the u.s and canadian rockies a thunderstorm can be in an adjacent valley and not be observable either visually or audibly from the valley where the lightning bolt strikes european and asian mountainous areas experience similar events also in clear areas where the storm cell is on the near horizon within 26 km 16 mi a strike can occur and as the storm is so far away the strike is referred to as clear-air citation needed energy see also sprite lightning upper-atmospheric lightning and st elmo s fire how thunderstorms launch particle beams into space if the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated in a typical thunderstorm approximately 5×108 kg of water vapor are lifted and the amount of energy released when this condenses is 1015 joules this is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at hiroshima japan in 1945 10 the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor results show that gamma rays and antimatter particles positrons can be generated in powerful thunderstorms 97 it is suggested that the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes tgf tgfs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning the streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays 98 about 500 tgfs may occur every day worldwide but mostly go undetected studies in more contemporary times thunderstorms have taken on the role of a scientific curiosity every spring storm chasers head to the great plains of the united states and the canadian prairies to explore the scientific aspects of storms and tornadoes through use of videotaping 99 radio pulses produced by cosmic rays are being used to study how electric charges develop within thunderstorms 100 more organized meteorological projects such as vortex2 use an array of sensors such as the doppler on wheels vehicles with mounted automated weather stations weather balloons and unmanned aircraft to investigate thunderstorms expected to produce severe weather 101 lightning is detected remotely using sensors that detect cloud-to-ground lightning strokes with 95 percent accuracy in detection and within 250 metres 820 ft of their point of origin 102 mythology and religion thunderstorms strongly influenced many early civilizations greeks believed that they were battles waged by zeus who hurled lightning bolts forged by hephaestus some american indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the thunderbird who they believed was a servant of the great spirit 103 the norse considered thunderstorms to occur when thor went to fight jötnar with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer mjölnir hinduism recognizes indra as the god of rain and thunderstorms christian doctrine accepted the ideas of aristotle s original work called meteorologica that winds were caused by exhalations from the earth and that fierce storms were the work of god these ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century 104 martin luther was out walking when a thunderstorm began causing him to pray to god for being saved and promising to become a monk 105 outside of earth thunderstorms evidenced by flashes of lightning on jupiter have been detected and are associated with clouds where water may exist as both a liquid and ice suggesting that a similar mechanism may act as on earth water is a polar molecule that can carry a charge so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning 106 these electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on the earth 107 the water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior 108 the clouds of venus may also be capable of producing lightning some observations suggest that the lightning rate is at least half of that on earth 109

goods to the british isles and beyond in part because of its merchants numerous trading ties with other parts of the british empire norfolk served as a strong base of loyalist support during the early part of the american revolution after fleeing the colonial capital of williamsburg lord dunmore the royal governor of virginia tried to reestablish control of the colony from norfolk dunmore secured small victories at norfolk but was forced into exile by the american rebels commanded by colonel woodford his departure brought an end to more than 168 years of british colonial rule in virginia 9 on

a serious economic setback during the 1820s agrarian communities across the american south suffered a prolonged recession which caused many families to migrate to other areas many moved west into the piedmont or further into kentucky and tennessee such migration also followed the exhaustion of soil due to tobacco cultivation in the tidewater where it had been the primary commodity crop for generations virginia made some attempts to phase out slavery and manumissions had increased in the first two decades after the war thomas jefferson randolph gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state but by that time increased demand from development in the deep south created a large internal market for slavery the invention of the cotton gin in the late-eighteenth century had enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton in the uplands which was widely used the american colonization society proposed to repatriate free blacks and freed slaves to africa by establishing the new colony of liberia and paying for transportation but most african-americans wanted to stay in their birthplace of the united states and achieve freedom and rights there for a period many emigrants to liberia from virginia and north carolina embarked from the port of norfolk joseph jenkins roberts a free person of color native to norfolk emigrated via the american

of the city s population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic no one understood how the disease was transmitted with both norfolk and portsmouth being infected new york banned all traffic from those sites neighboring cities also banned residents from norfolk the epidemic spread through the city via mosquitoes and poor sanitation affecting every family and causing widespread panic the number of infected reached 5,000 in september and by the second week 1,500 had died in norfolk and portsmouth as the weather cooled the outbreak began to wane leaving a final tally of about 3,200 dead

hampton roads took place off the northwest shore of the city s sewell s point peninsula marking the first fight between two ironclads the uss monitor and the css virginia the battle ended in a stalemate but changed the course of naval warfare from then on warships were fortified with metal 14 in may 1862 norfolk mayor william lamb surrendered the city to union general john e wool and his forces they held the city under martial law for the duration of the civil war thousands of slaves from the region escaped to union lines to gain freedom they quickly set up schools in norfolk to start

highways were constructed in the region a series of bridges and tunnels constructed during fifteen years linked norfolk with the peninsula portsmouth and virginia beach in 1952 the downtown tunnel opened to connect norfolk with the city of portsmouth the highways also stimulated the development of new housing suburbs leading to the population spreading out additional bridges and tunnels

ruled in brown v board of education that segregated public schools were unconstitutional as the public system was supported by all taxpayers it ordered integration but virginia pursued a policy of massive resistance at this time most black citizens were still disfranchised under the state s turn-of-the-century constitution and discriminatory practices related to voter registration and elections the virginia general assembly prohibited state funding for integrated public schools in 1958 united states district courts in virginia ordered schools to open for the first time on a racially integrated basis in response governor james lindsay almond jr ordered the schools closed the virginia supreme court of appeals declared the state law to be in conflict with the state constitution and ordered all public schools to be funded whether integrated or not about ten days later almond capitulated and asked the general assembly to rescind several massive resistance laws 24 in september 1959 seventeen black children entered six previously segregated norfolk public schools virginian-pilot editor lenoir chambers editorialized against massive resistance and earned the pulitzer prize for editorial writing 25 with new suburban developments beckoning many white middle-class residents moved out of the city along new highway routes and norfolk s population declined a pattern repeated in numerous cities during the postwar era independently of segregation issues in the late-1960s and early-1970s the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown s granby street commercial corridor located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront the opening of malls and large shopping centers drew off retail business from granby street 26 norfolk s city leaders began a long push to revive its urban core while granby street underwent decline norfolk city leaders focused on the waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished in their place planners created a new boulevard waterside drive along which many of the high-rise buildings in norfolk s skyline have been erected in 1983 the city and the rouse company developed the waterside festival marketplace to attract people back to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment 27 other facilities opened in the ensuing years including the harbor park baseball stadium home of the norfolk tides triple-a minor league baseball team in 1995 the park was named the finest facility in

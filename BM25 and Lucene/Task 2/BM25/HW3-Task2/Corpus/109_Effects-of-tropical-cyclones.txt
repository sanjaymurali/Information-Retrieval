american tropical cyclone casualties by cause from 1970–1999 the main effects of tropical cyclones include heavy rain strong wind large storm surges at landfall and tornadoes the destruction from a tropical cyclone depends mainly on its intensity its size and its location tropical cyclones act to remove forest canopy as well as change the landscape near coastal areas by moving and reshaping sand dunes and causing extensive erosion along the coast even well inland heavy rainfall can lead to mudslides and landslides in mountainous areas their effects can be sensed over time by studying the concentration of the oxygen-18 isotope within caves within the vicinity of cyclones paths being very hazardous to people s life after the cyclone has passed devastation often continues standing water can cause the spread of disease and transportation or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed hampering clean-up and rescue efforts nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones despite their devastating effects tropical cyclones are also beneficial by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward out at sea ships take advantage of their known characteristics by navigating through their weaker western half when a cyclone hits it causes pst hazards pst is an acronym standing for primary secondary and tertiary a primary hazard involves destructive winds debris and storm surge secondary hazard is flooding fires and of course fresh water flooding finally tertiary hazards involves food prices that go majorly up and other long term hazards like water poisoning at sea edit a mature tropical cyclone can release heat at a rate upwards of 6x1014 watts 1 tropical cyclones on the open sea cause large waves heavy rain and high winds disrupting international shipping and at times causing shipwrecks 2 generally after its passage a tropical cyclone stirs up ocean water lowering sea surface temperatures behind it 3 this cool wake can cause the region to be less favorable for a subsequent tropical cyclone on rare occasions tropical cyclones may actually do the opposite 2005 s hurricane dennis blew warm water behind it contributing to the unprecedented intensity of hurricane emily which followed it closely 4 hurricanes help to maintain the global heat balance by moving warm moist tropical air to the mid-latitudes and polar regions 5 were it not for the movement of heat poleward through other means as well as hurricanes the tropical regions would be unbearably hot north american colonization edit shipwrecks are common with the passage of strong tropical cyclones such shipwrecks can change the course of history 6 as well as influence art and literature a hurricane led to a victory of the spanish over the french for control of fort caroline and ultimately the atlantic coast of north america in 1565 7 the sea venture was wrecked near bermuda in 1609 which led to the colonization of bermuda 8 and provided the inspiration for shakespeare s the tempest shipping edit the dangerous semicircle is the upper-right corner with the arrow marking the direction of motion of a northern hemisphere storm note that typhoons etc are asymmetrical and semicircle is a convenient misnomer mariners have a way to safely navigate around tropical cyclones they split tropical cyclones in two based on their direction of motion and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the northern hemisphere the left in the southern hemisphere sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm as the cyclone s translation speed and its rotational wind are additive the other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle 9 since weather conditions are lessened subtractive in this portion of the storm but are still potentially quite hazardous the rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path crossing the t those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible 10 11 upon landfall edit the most significant effects of a tropical cyclone occur when they cross coastlines making landfall then it destroys ships and lives strong winds edit see also tropical cyclone windspeed climatology strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles buildings bridges personal property and other outside objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles in the united states major hurricanes comprise just 21 of all land falling tropical cyclones but account for 83 of all damage 12 tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts 13 tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges overpasses and roads complicating efforts to transport food clean water and medicine to the areas that need it furthermore the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region and to a diaspora of the population of the region 14 storm surge edit the aftermath of hurricane katrina in gulfport mississippi katrina was the costliest tropical cyclone in united states history see also storm surge the storm surge or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90 of tropical cyclone deaths 14 the relatively quick surge in sea level can move miles kilometers inland flooding homes and cutting off escape routes the storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries which are typically important fish breeding locales heavy rainfall edit see also tropical cyclone rainfall climatology the thunderstorm activity in a tropical cyclone produces intense rainfall potentially resulting in flooding mudslides and landslides inland areas are particularly vulnerable to freshwater flooding due to residents not preparing adequately 15 heavy inland rainfall eventually flows into coastal estuaries damaging marine life in coastal estuaries 16 the wet environment in the aftermath of a tropical cyclone combined with the destruction of sanitation facilities and a warm tropical climate can induce epidemics of disease which claim lives long after the storm passes 14 infections of cuts and bruises can be greatly amplified by wading in sewage-polluted water large areas of standing water caused by flooding also contribute to mosquito-borne illnesses furthermore crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation 14 flooding in seminole county florida from tropical storm fay 2008 although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions hurricanes in the eastern north pacific often supply moisture to the southwestern united states and parts of mexico 17 japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons 18 hurricane camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path 19 though it also killed 259 people and caused 9.14 billion 2005 usd in damage on the other hand the occurrence of tropical cyclones can cause tremendous variability in rainfall over the areas they affect indeed cyclones are the primary cause of the most extreme rainfall variability in the world observed in places such as onslow and port hedland in subtropical australia where the annual rainfall can range from practically nothing with no cyclones to over 1,000 millimetres 39 in if cyclones are abundant tornadoes edit main article history of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes the broad rotation of a land falling tropical cyclone often spawns tornadoes particularly in their right front quadrant while these tornadoes are normally not as strong as their non-tropical counterparts heavy damage or loss of life can still occur tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices which persist until landfall 20 deaths edit deaths per year from tropical cyclones australia 5 21 united states 25 22 east asia 740 23 globally 10000 22 during the last two centuries tropical cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about 1.9 million people worldwide it is estimated that 10,000 people per year perish due to tropical cyclones 22 the deadliest tropical cyclone was the 1970 bhola cyclone which had a death toll of anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 lives united states edit before hurricane katrina the average death rate for tropical cyclones in the united states was decreasing the main cause of storm-related fatalities was shifting away from storm surge and towards freshwater flooding 24 however the median death rate per storm had increased through 1979 with a lull during the 1980–1995 period this was due to greater numbers of people moving to the coastal margins and into harm s way despite advances in warning strategies and reduction in track forecast error this increase in fatalities is expected to continue for as long as people migrate towards the shore 25 reconstruction and repopulation edit aerial image of destroyed houses in tacloban following typhoon haiyan while tropical cyclones may well seriously damage settlement total destruction encourages rebuilding for example the destruction wrought by hurricane camille on the gulf coast spurred redevelopment greatly increasing local property values 19 research indicates that the typical hurricane strike raises real house prices for a number of years with a maximum effect of between 3 percent to 4 percent three years after occurrence 26 however disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms hurricane katrina is the most obvious example as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after hurricane camille many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well in isolated areas with small populations tropical cyclones may cause enough casualties to contribute to the founder s effect as survivors repopulate their place for example around 1775 a typhoon hit pingelap atoll and in combination with a subsequent famine reduced the island s population to a low level several generations after the disaster as many as 10 of pingelapese have a genetic form of color-blindness called achromatopsia 27 this is due to one of the survivors of the depopulation brought on by the typhoon having a mutated gene which the population bottleneck caused to be at a higher-than-usual level in succeeding generations 27 hurricane isabel 2003 s effect on the north carolina outer banks effects on natural resources edit geomorphology edit tropical cyclones reshape the geology near the coast by eroding sand from the beach as well as offshore rearranging coral and changing dune configuration onshore their rain water gets absorbed into stalagmites within caves creating a record of past tropical cyclone impacts coastal ridges edit waves and storm surges accompanying tropical cyclones erode undersea sands erode shell deposits break off corals from near shore reefs in their paths and carry all this detritus landwards in a rolling wave of material that is deposited onshore above highest astronomical tide as a ridge of sand shell and coral 28 for example each severe tropical cyclone i.e category 4–5 on the saffir-simpson scale crossing northeast australia s tropical coastline since the last significant change in sea levels about 5000 years ago has emplaced such ridges within the coastal landscape forming in some places series of ridges and a geomorphological record of highest magnitude cyclones hitting the coast over 3000 – 5000 years 29 eyewitness accounts verify ridges of this kind are formed by severe tropical cyclones and two clear examples cited are the 18 kilometres 11 mi long 35 metres 115 ft wide 3.5 metres 11 ft high coral shingle ridge deposited on funafuti atoll central south pacific by cyclone bebe in october 1972 and the large coral shingle ridge deposited on jaluit atoll marshall islands by typhoon ophelia in january 1958 in tropical northeast australia an intense tropical cyclone hit in march 1918 crossing over the town of innisfail at which time there were eyewitness accounts of a 4.5 metres 15 ft to 5.1 metres 17 ft high ridge of pumice being deposited by that cyclone s surge as it crossed the coast 28 limestone cave stalagmites edit when tropical cyclones cross land thin layers of calcium carbonate of light composition i.e unusual isotopic ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 are deposited onto stalagmites in limestone caves up to 300 kilometres 190 mi from the cyclone s path 29 as the cloud tops of tropical cyclones are high and cold and their air is humid – their rainwater is lighter in other words the rainfall contains significantly higher quantities of unevaporated oxygen-18 than other tropical rainfall the isotopically lighter rainwater soaks into the ground percolates down into caves and within a couple of weeks oxygen-18 transfers from the water into calcium carbonate before being deposited in thin layers or rings within stalagmites a succession of such events created within stalagmites maintain a record of cyclones tracking within a 300 kilometres 190 mi radius of caves going back centuries millennia or even millions of years 30 at actun tunichil muknal cave in central belize researchers drilling stalagmites with a computer controlled dental drill accurately identified and verified evidence of isotopically light rainfall for 11 tropical cyclones occurring over a 23-year period 1978–2001 30 at the chillagoe limestone caves in northeast australia 130 kilometres 81 mi inland from cairns researchers identified and matched evidence of isotopically light rainfall with 100 years of cyclone records and from this have created a record of tropical cyclones from 2004 back to 1200 a.d an 800-year record 29 landscapes edit severe tropical cyclones defoliate tropical forest canopy trees remove vines and epiphytes from the trees break tree crown stems and cause tree falls the degree of damage they do along their paths at a landscape level i.e 10 kilometres 6.2 mi can be catastrophic yet variable and patchy 31 trees break at 42 m s regardless of size and type 32 33 stripping trees and scattering forest debris also provides fuel for wildfires such as a blaze that lasted three months in 1989 and burned 460 square miles 1,200 km2 of forest that had been stripped by hurricane gilbert 34 wind velocity gradients or horizontal wind shear size of cyclone the intensity of cyclone proximity to the cyclone and local scale cyclonic convection effects degree of exposure windward exposure leeward acceleration or local topographic sheltering shading and ecosystem species composition and forest structure assessments of cyclone damage done to tropical rainforest landscapes in northeast australia have produced the following typology for describing and mapping the variable impacts they have along their paths as follows 35 severe and extensive closest to the centre of cyclone impact appears to be multidirectional and is evidenced by crowns of most trees having been broken smashed or windthrown severe and localised closer to the cyclone centre than its edge direction of the destructive winds is clearly identifiable and severe canopy disruption is limited to the windward aspect of these forested areas moderate canopy disturbance closer to cyclone edge than its centre most of the tree stems are still standing with only some treefalls and most of the damage is the defoliation of the canopy and branch breakage slight canopy disturbance closest to cyclone edge occasional stem fall or branch breakage with most of the damage consisting of loss of foliage on the forest edges only subsequently followed by leaf damage and heavy leaf litter falls

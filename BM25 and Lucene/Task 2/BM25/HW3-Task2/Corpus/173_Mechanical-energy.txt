mechanical energy wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search an example of a mechanical system a satellite is orbiting the earth influenced only by the conservative gravitational force its mechanical energy is therefore conserved the satellite is accelerated towards the earth with an acceleration perpendicular to the velocity this acceleration is represented by a green acceleration vector and the velocity is represented by a red velocity vector though the velocity is constantly changed with the direction of the vector because of the acceleration vector the speed of the satellite is not since the magnitude of the velocity vector remains unchanged in the physical sciences mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy it is the energy associated with the motion and position of an object the principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system that is only subject to conservative forces the mechanical energy is constant if an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force the potential energy will increase and if the speed not the velocity of the object is changed the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well in all real systems however nonconservative forces like frictional forces will be present but often they are of negligible values and the mechanical energy s being constant can therefore be a useful approximation in elastic collisions the mechanical energy is conserved but in inelastic collisions some mechanical energy is converted into heat the equivalence between lost mechanical energy dissipation and an increase in temperature was discovered by james prescott joule many devices are used to convert mechanical energy to or from other forms of energy e.g an electric motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy an electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and a steam engine converts heat energy to mechanical energy general edit energy is a scalar quantity and the mechanical energy of a system is the sum of the potential energy which is measured by the position of the parts of the system the kinetic energy which is also called the energy of motion 1 2 e m e c h a n i c a l u k displaystyle e mathrm mechanical u k the potential energy u depends on the position of an object subjected to a conservative force it is defined as the object s ability to do work and is increased as the object is moved in the opposite direction of the direction of the force nb 1 1 if f represents the conservative force and x the position the potential energy of the force between the two positions x1 and x2 is defined as the negative integral of f from x1 to x2 4 u − ∫ x 1 x 2 f → ⋅ d x → displaystyle u int limits x 1 x 2 vec f cdot d vec x the kinetic energy k depends on the speed of an object and is the ability of a moving object to do work on other objects when it collides with them nb 2 8 it is defined as one half the product of the object s mass with the square of its speed and the total kinetic energy of a system of objects is the sum of the kinetic energies of the respective objects 1 9 k 1 2 m v 2 displaystyle k 1 over 2 mv 2 the principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if a body or system is subjected only to conservative forces the mechanical energy of that body or system remains constant 10 the difference between a conservative and a non-conservative force is that when a conservative force moves an object from one point to another the work done by the conservative force is independent of the path on the contrary when a non-conservative force acts upon an object the work done by the non-conservative force is dependent of the path 11 12 conservation of mechanical energy edit play media mit professor walter lewin demonstrating conservation of mechanical energy according to the principle of conservation of mechanical energy the mechanical energy of an isolated system remains constant in time as long as the system is free of friction and other non-conservative forces in any real situation frictional forces and other non-conservative forces are present but in many cases their effects on the system are so small that the principle of conservation of mechanical energy can be used as a fair approximation though energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system it can be converted to another form of energy 1 13 swinging pendulum edit a swinging pendulum with the velocity vector green and acceleration vector blue the magnitude of the velocity vector the speed of the pendulum is greatest in the vertical position and the pendulum is farthest from earth in its extreme positions main article pendulum thus in a mechanical system like a swinging pendulum subjected to the conservative gravitational force where frictional forces like air drag and friction at the pivot are negligible energy passes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy but never leaves the system the pendulum reaches greatest kinetic energy and least potential energy when in the vertical position because it will have the greatest speed and be nearest the earth at this point on the other hand it will have its least kinetic energy and greatest potential energy at the extreme positions of its swing because it has zero speed and is farthest from earth at these points however when taking the frictional forces into account the system loses mechanical energy with each swing because of the work done by the pendulum to oppose these non-conservative forces 2 irreversibilities edit main article irreversible process that the loss of mechanical energy in a system always resulted in an increase of the system s temperature has been known for a long time but it was the amateur physicist james prescott joule who first experimentally demonstrated how a certain amount of work done against friction resulted in a definite quantity of heat which should be conceived as the random motions of the particles that comprise matter 14 this equivalence between mechanical energy and heat is especially important when considering colliding objects in an elastic collision mechanical energy is conserved – the sum of the mechanical energies of the colliding objects is the same before and after the collision after an inelastic collision however the mechanical energy of the system will have changed usually the mechanical energy before the collision is greater than the mechanical energy after the collision in inelastic collisions some of the mechanical energy of the colliding objects is transformed into kinetic energy of the constituent particles this increase in kinetic energy of the constituent particles is perceived as an increase in temperature the collision can be described by saying some of the mechanical energy of the colliding objects has been converted into an equal amount of heat thus the total energy of the system remains unchanged though the mechanical energy of the system has reduced 1 15 satellite edit main article vis-viva equation plot of kinetic energy k displaystyle k

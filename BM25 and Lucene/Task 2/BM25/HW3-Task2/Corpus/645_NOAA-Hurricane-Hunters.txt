noaa hurricane hunters wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the noaa hurricane hunters are a group of aircraft that work under the aircraft operations center aoc located at lakeland linder regional airport in lakeland florida united states the aircraft operations center is under the office of marine and aviation operations omao which is a branch of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa which is in turn an agency of the department of commerce the aoc resided at macdill afb from january 1993 to june 2017 1 2 noaa announced that in 2013 doppler weather radar data will be transmitted from hurricane hunter aircraft in real time this should help forecasters more quickly analyze storm conditions and could improve hwrf model forecast accuracy by 10 to 15 percent 3 about edit the noaa hurricane hunters conduct research using special aircraft in order to support noaa s mission of predicting changes in the earth s environment and managing coastal and marine resources aoc crews fly through hurricanes to help forecasters and scientists gather both operational and research data in addition the crews conduct a number of other research projects including ocean wind studies winter storm research thunderstorm research coastal erosion and air chemistry flights to name a few aircraft edit noaa uses two lockheed wp-3d orion turboprops to fly through hurricanes and a gulfstream iv-sp which flies around the upper fringes of storms to get a read on steering currents 4 the noaa also uses light aircraft for some of its research in conjunction with jim henson productions noaa s p-3s are nicknamed kermit the frog n42rf and miss piggy n43rf the g-iv n49rf is nicknamed gonzo wp-3 edit noaa s lockheed wp-3d orion the wp-3 was designed to tolerate large amounts of turbulence since it flies through the eyes of hurricanes 5 the wp-3 can be thought of as a flying research lab as it is equipped to take atmospheric measurements one of the most distinctive parts of the wp-3 is the prominent black circular belly radome staffed with 18 to 20 crew members including pilots and scientists a normal hurricane reconnaissance or research mission can last from 9–10 hours while a surveillance fix mission mission will typically last 8 hours often in rotation with wc-130 flights from the air force reserve command s 53rd weather reconnaissance squadron 53 wrs at six-hour intervals most often the scientists and crew aboard the aircraft deploy dropsondes with gps which collect and transmit data as they descend toward the ocean once this data is received and checked by the crew it is sent to the noaa national hurricane center for analysis other data is collected and transmitted by request personnel on board include pilots navigators engineers technicians and flight meteorologists flight directors past projects use the wp-3 have included low level jet observation over south america a bow echo and mesoscale convective study in the midwest and ocean wind satellite verification missions over the northern atlantic and pacific g-iv edit noaa s gulfstream iv-sp the g-iv is a high altitude jet that can fly up to 45,000 feet the g-iv crew is similar to the wp-3 and includes pilots engineers technicians and a flight meteorologist flight director the g-iv flies around the periphery of both tropical and winter storms including hurricanes and drops sondes in order to gather data about the surrounding environment this information is used to help predict the path of hurricanes dropsonde transmissions are collected and checked by an on-board flight director who then transmits the data to the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the national hurricane center nhc for analysis the g-iv serves the ncep winter storm reconnaissance program in order to better predict the location and intensity of winter storms that affect the united states the program was started by ncep national center for environmental prediction during winter storm reconnaissance air chemistry measurements are also taken from the upper troposphere these flights are typically flown from honolulu anchorage or yokota ab japan

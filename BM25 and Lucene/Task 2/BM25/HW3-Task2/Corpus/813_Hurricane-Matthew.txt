since hurricane sandy in 2012 as well as the ninth-costliest atlantic hurricane in recorded history originating from a tropical wave that emerged off africa on september 22 matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the lesser antilles on september 28 it became a hurricane north of venezuela and colombia on september 29 before undergoing explosive intensification ultimately reaching category 5 intensity on october 1 at just 13.4°n latitude – the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the atlantic basin breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004 1 matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the greater antilles remaining a strong category 4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over haiti s tiburon peninsula early on october 4 and then a second one in cuba later that day matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest making landfall in the northern bahamas the storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern united states over the next 36 hours gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the cape romain national wildlife refuge near myrtle beach south carolina as a category 1 hurricane on the morning of october 8 matthew re-emerged into the atlantic shortly afterward eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from cape hatteras north carolina on october 9 2 widespread effects were felt from matthew across its destructive path however the most

the previous year grand bahama was hit directly where most homes sustained damage in the townships of eight mile rock and holmes rock preparations began in earnest across the southeastern united states as matthew approached with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding especially in the jacksonville metropolitan area in florida over 1 million lost power as the storm passed to the east with 478,000 losing power in georgia and south carolina while damage was primarily confined to the coast in florida and georgia torrential rains spread inland in the carolinas and virginia causing widespread flooding meteorological history edit main article meteorological history of hurricane matthew map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 22 and moved rapidly across the atlantic being monitored by the national hurricane center nhc for possible tropical cyclogenesis despite possessing tropical-storm winds as it approached the lesser antilles on september 27 the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center however by 12 00 utc on september 28 the wave developed a closed circulation while located near barbados hence becoming a tropical storm and was assigned the name matthew continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18 00 utc on september 29 the effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day and matthew began a period of explosive intensification during a 24-hour period beginning at 00 00 utc on september 30 the cyclone s maximum winds more than doubled from 80 mph 130 km h to 165 mph 270 km h making matthew a category 5 hurricane 1 the first since hurricane felix in 2007 3 the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the atlantic since records began due to upwelling of cooler waters matthew weakened to a category 4 hurricane later on october 1 before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155 mph 250 km h late on october 2 1 slowly rounding the ridge matthew fluctuated in intensity within the category 4 range from october 1–5 intensification resumed again late on october 3 and culminated when matthew made landfall near les anglais haiti around 11 00 utc on october 4 with winds of 150 mph 240 km h and a pressure of 934 millibars 27.6 inhg making it the strongest to hit haiti since hurricane cleo in 1964 continuing northward the hurricane struck maisí in cuba early on october 5 as a slightly weaker storm cuba s and haiti s mountainous terrain weakened matthew to category 3 status as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the bahamas restrengthening occurred as matthew s circulation became better organized with the storm becoming a category 4 hurricane again while passing freeport however matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place the storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of florida and georgia with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in florida while the system was a category 3 hurricane with the strongest winds remaining just offshore matthew weakened to a category 2 hurricane late on october 7 and then to a category 1 hurricane by 12 00 utc on october 8 1 the eye of hurricane matthew seen from the international space station on october 3 around 15 00 utc on october 8 the hurricane made landfall at cape romain national wildlife refuge near mcclellanville south carolina with winds of 85 mph 140 km h and a central pressure of 963 mbar 28.4 inhg which made it the strongest to strike the united states in terms of pressure since hurricane isaac in 2012 and the first hurricane to make landfall north of florida in october since hurricane hazel in 1954 nb 1 4 1 convection became displaced from the center as matthew pulled away

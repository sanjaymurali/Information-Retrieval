meteorological history effects florida the bahamas other wikis commons wilma images hurricane wilma was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the atlantic basin as well as the most intense recorded in the western hemisphere until hurricane patricia in 2015 part of the record-breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane season which included three of the top ten most intense atlantic hurricanes ever along with 4 rita and 7 katrina wilma was the twenty-second storm thirteenth hurricane sixth major hurricane fourth category 5 hurricane and second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 season a tropical depression formed in the caribbean sea near jamaica on october 15 headed westward and two days later intensified into a tropical storm which turned abruptly southward and was named wilma wilma continued to strengthen and eventually became a hurricane on october 18 shortly thereafter explosive intensification occurred and in only 24 hours wilma became a category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of 185 miles per hour 298 km h wilma s intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a category 5 hurricane and winds had decreased to 150 miles per hour 240 km h before it reached the yucatán peninsula on october 20 and 21 after crossing the yucatán wilma emerged into the gulf of mexico as a category 2 hurricane as wilma began accelerating to the northeast gradual re-intensification occurred and the hurricane was upgraded to category 3 on october 24 shortly thereafter wilma made landfall in cape romano florida with winds of 120 miles per hour 190 km h as wilma was crossing florida it briefly weakened back to a category 2 hurricane but again re-intensified as it reached the atlantic ocean the hurricane intensified into a category 3 hurricane for the last time but dropped below that intensity while accelerating northeastward by october 26 wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of nova scotia wilma made several landfalls with the most destructive effects felt in the yucatán peninsula of mexico cuba and the u.s state of florida at least 62 deaths were reported and damage total estimated at 29.4 billion equivalent to 36.1 billion in 2017 with in the united states 21 billion 25.8 billion in 2017 1 as a result wilma is ranked as the sixth costliest hurricane in united states history wilma was the most recent major hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous united states until hurricane harvey made landfall in southern texas on august 26 2017 ending a record length of time – slightly over 11 years and 10 months – without any major hurricanes making landfall in the united states wilma was also the last hurricane to strike the state of florida until hurricane hermine did so nearly 11 years later in 2016 another record wilma was also the last major hurricane to make landfall in florida until hurricane irma made landfall in early september 2017 meteorological history edit main article meteorological history of hurricane wilma map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the caribbean sea during mid-october as a lower-tropospheric low interacted with a broad area of disturbed weather aided by an upper-level low across the region a broad area of low pressure developed on october 13 to the southeast of jamaica and slowly became more concentrated as upper-level wind shear gradually decreased dvorak classifications began on october 14 and by late october 15 the surface circulation in the system became well enough defined with sufficiently organized deep convection for the national hurricane center to designate the system as tropical depression twenty-four while located about 220 mi 350 km east-southeast of grand cayman 1 the depression drifted southwestward because of the influence of two ridges to its north and with warm sea surface temperatures and a favorable upper-level environment it strengthened into tropical storm wilma on october 17 initially development was slow due to the large size of the storm and a flat pressure gradient however convection gradually organized and from october 18 through october 19 wilma underwent explosive deepening over the open waters of the caribbean sea around 12 00 utc on october 18 the system intensified into a hurricane in a 30‑hour period the pressure dropped from 982 mbar hpa 29.00 inhg to the record-low of 882 mbar hpa 26.05 inhg while the winds increased to 185 mph 295 km h during its intensification on october 19 the hurricane s eye shrank to as small as 2.3 mi 3.7 km in diameter becoming the smallest eye ever seen in a tropical cyclone 1 play media satellite video of wilma s lifespan on october 20 wilma weakened below category 5 intensity to 155 mph 250 km h due to an eyewall replacement cycle began to turn towards the northwest and further slowed its movement late on october 21 wilma made landfall on the island of cozumel quintana roo at around 21 45 utc with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph 240 km h and then again made a second landfall on the mexican mainland six hours later and only slightly weaker wilma continued to slowly drift towards the north over the yucatán peninsula although it weakened to a moderate hurricane while over land it reemerged over the southern gulf of mexico on october 23 around 00 00 utc despite wilma spending 24 hours over land it reëmerged with little intensity lost and began to re-intensify shortly after this was perhaps due to its large size and because the majority of its circulation remained over the warm waters of the northwest caribbean and gulf of mexico a powerful trough turned the hurricane to the northeast and accelerated its forward motion its large eye remained well-organized and wilma intensified despite increasing amounts of wind shear briefly producing winds of 125 mph 200 km h before making landfall on cape romano florida as a 120 mph 195 km h major hurricane 1 wilma crossed the state in about 4.6 hours and weakened to a category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph 175 km h after entering the atlantic ocean near jupiter florida key west received several feet of water in the low-lying areas and flooded homes the lower keys also experienced an unusual flood it occurred twice first as the storm approached florida it pushed water across the keys from south to north as the storm finally crossed into the everglades all the water that had been pushed by the storm was released as wilma crossed the peninsula the water then raced back across the lower keys a second time and went back out to sea this caused additional flooding and costly damage possibly due to less friction of the eyewall or moving over warm waters of the gulf stream wilma again re-intensified to reach winds of 125 mph 200 km h and subsequently absorbed tropical storm alpha to the south before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection on october 26 wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and on the next day the remnants of wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over atlantic canada 1 preparations

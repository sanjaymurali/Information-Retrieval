season hurricane michelle was the fifth costliest tropical cyclone in cuban history and strongest of the 2001 atlantic hurricane season the thirteenth named storm and seventh hurricane that year michelle developed from a tropical wave that had traversed into the western caribbean sea on october 29 the wave had initially moved off the coast of africa 13 days prior in its early developmental stages the depression meandered over nicaragua later paralleling the mosquito coast before intensifying into tropical storm intensity on november 1 michelle was upgraded to hurricane strength the following day shortly after rapid intensification ensued within favorable conditions with the storm s central barometric pressure dropping 51 mbar hpa 1.51 inhg in 29 hours after a slight fluctuation in strength michelle reached its peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane with winds of 140 mph 225 km h and a minimum pressure of 933 mbar hpa 27.55 inhg nb 1 at roughly the same time the hurricane began to accelerate northeastward this brought the intense hurricane to a cuban landfall within the bay of pigs later that day crossing over the island michelle was weakened significantly and was only a category 1 hurricane upon reentry into the atlantic ocean the hurricane later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the bahamas on november 5 before being absorbed by a cold front the following day hurricane michelle caused widespread devastation across the western caribbean during its eight-day trek as a tropical wave torrential rainfall occurred across jamaica causing mudslides and killing two people damage in the island country was estimated at 18 million nb 2 when the storm drifted over areas of central america early in its existence heavy rains isolated numerous villages and damaged infrastructure affecting areas affected by hurricane mitch roughly three years prior in honduras and nicaragua 14 people were killed with an additional 62 people unaccounted for in the cayman islands areas were affected by strong storm surge and flooding particularly in grand cayman where damage was totaled 28 million the majority of damage caused by michelle occurred in cuba where the storm was the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall on the island in over 49 years strong storm surge and heavy rainfall disrupted communication networks across the country high winds and rain also destroyed buildings and damaged the sugar cane crop at the time michelle was the costliest hurricane in cuban history with an estimated 1.8 billion in damage this figure was greatly surpassed by hurricane ike nearly seven years later as a weakening system michelle moved past florida and the bahamas strong waves caused severe beach erosion and winds damaged property throughout the entirety of michelle s track 22 people were killed and damage was estimated at roughly 2 billion 2001 usd 2.71 billion 2017 usd after the season the name michelle was retired and was replaced with melissa for the 2007 atlantic hurricane season meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on october 16 2001 a tropical wave moved westward off the coast of africa and moved into the atlantic ocean at the time the wave produced minimal convective and thunderstorm activity on october 23 the disturbance crossed the lesser antilles before moving into the caribbean sea while showing minimal signs of tropical development three days later the wave moved into the western caribbean spawning a broad low-pressure area off the coast of nicaragua at 1800 utc on october 29 1 a reconnaissance flight confirmed the development of a tropical depression 40 mi 60 km south-southwest of puerto cabezas nicaragua 2 at the time convection was displaced primarily to the north of the center of circulation and the storm was situated in a weak steering pattern as such initial forecasts predicted for the depression designated as tropical depression fifteen to slowly move generally northward 3 later that day a burst of convection occurred over the circulation center of the depression indicating an increase in organization 4 the disturbance meandered over eastern nicaragua for 36 hours before emerging into the caribbean sea near cabo gracias a dios by 2100 utc on october 31 1 5 upon emerging into the caribbean sea the depression quickly organized and the national hurricane center  nhc upgraded the depression to tropical storm strength at 0000 utc the following day based on information from a reconnaissance flight prior as such the tropical storm was designated with the name michelle 6 7 gradual strengthening occurred throughout november 1 as michelle s cloud tops began to cool as it drifted northward signifying strengthening at the time the nhc predicted that there was a roughly 12 percent chance for the tropical storm to rapidly intensify by that time the storm had met three of the organization s five criterion for rapid intensification 8 during the day fluctuations in convective activity occurred and there were some signs of wind shear affecting the cyclone but there was a general strengthening trend 9 two dropsondes deployed within the system early on november 2 observed hurricane-force winds within michelle based on this data the nhc upgraded michelle to hurricane intensity at 1200 utc that day 7 while the storm was situated 290 mi 460 km south-southeast of the guanahacabibes peninsula 10 hurricane michelle undergoing extratropical transition over the bahamas on november 5 a period of rapid intensification began shortly after as michelle s satellite presentation improved with the cyclone s minimum barometric pressure falling 51 mbar hpa 1.51 inhg in 29 hours 1 at 0000 utc on november 3 the hurricane attained category 2 hurricane intensity at roughly the same time the hurricane s eye became more apparent on satellite imagery 11 by 1200 utc later that day michelle had intensified to a category 4 hurricane 7 six hours later the hurricane weakened to category 3 intensity but reached its minimum barometric pressure of 934 mbar hpa 27.58 inhg afterwards michelle s central pressure began to rise despite the trend its maximum sustained winds also strengthened as it curved northeastward 7 despite having its convective organization disrupted and its eye no longer as apparent on november 4 12 michelle attained winds of 140 mph 220 km h by 0600 utc that day these would be the highest sustained winds estimated for the system throughout its existence 7 at 1800 utc on november 4 michelle made landfall on cayo largo del sur as a category 4 hurricane with winds of 140 mph 220 km h this was followed shortly after with a landfall on the bay of pigs five hours later as a slightly weaker storm when michelle made landfall on the cuban mainland it was the strongest landfalling hurricane in cuban history since the landfall of hurricane fox in 1952 at the time the hurricane s minimum barometric pressure was 950 mbar hpa 28.06 inhg over cuba michelle s center of circulation was significantly disrupted and as a result the hurricane decreased in intensity 1 by the time it had emerged into the atlantic ocean on november 5 winds were only estimated at 90 mph 150 km h 7 southwesterly wind shear further inhibited any additional tropical development and as such michelle began to transition into an extratropical cyclone 13 that day the weakening hurricane made landfalls over andros island and eleuthera island before becoming fully extratropical by 0000 utc on november 6 while still maintaining hurricane-force winds the extratropical system persisted for roughly 18 more hours before it was absorbed by an approaching cold front 1 preparations edit cuba edit warnings and watches associated with hurricane michelle as it made landfall on cuba on november 4 as hurricane michelle approached the cuban coast the government of cuba issued a hurricane watch for the western cuban provinces of pinar del río la habana matanzas and isla de la juventud at 2100 utc on november 1 14 the following day the same hurricane watch was extended eastward to include all provinces from pinar del río to ciego de Ávila 1 15 all hurricane watches in cuba were upgraded to hurricane warnings at 1100 utc on november 3 16 all warnings in cuba were discontinued once michelle began to accelerate out to sea at 1200 utc on november 5 1 prior to reaching the coast michelle was expected to be the strongest cuban tropical cyclone in at least 75 years the cuban red cross deployed 24,500 volunteers across cuba to assist civil defense teams in evacuation procedures for potentially affected populations by november 4 an estimated 590,000 people were evacuated across the country including 80 percent of the population of the province of pinar del río 17 in havana authorities evacuated 150,000 people coastal tourist resorts were cleared and 35,500 students were evacuated out of camps hosted on the zapata peninsula 18 on cuba s southwestern islands including cayo largo and isla de la juventud 500 tourists were evacuated the entire population of surgidero de batabanó was evacuated 19 in addition to the evacuations the government sent food water and medicine supplies to areas south of the capital all domestic and international flights to and from the country were cancelled 18 elsewhere edit at 1700 utc on november 1 a tropical storm watch was issued for grand cayman island 1 15 three hours prior the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm warning in conjunction with a hurricane watch for areas of the florida keys from ocean reef florida to the dry tortugas 16 at 0300 utc on november 4 a hurricane watch was issued for areas of the northwestern and central bahamas at the same time a new tropical storm warning was issued for the east coast of florida between jupiter inlet and ocean reef and for the state s western coast south of bonita beach at 0600 utc the tropical storm watch for grand cayman was upgraded and extended to include the entirety of the cayman islands six hours later the hurricane watch for the florida keys was upgraded to warning status early the next day a hurricane watch was issued for bermuda after michelle made its final cuban landfall meanwhile the tropical storm warning issued for the cayman islands was discontinued as michelle accelerated away from landmasses warnings and watches were discontinued all tropical cyclone warnings in the united states were discontinued by 2100 utc that day at the same time however the hurricane watch for bermuda was changed to a tropical storm warning this warning was sustained for a day before being discontinued shortly after all warnings in the bahamas were also discontinued 1 impact edit deaths and damage by region region total deaths missing damage usd source  bahamas 0 0 7008300000000000000♠ 300 million  cayman islands 0 0

killing 22 people and causing extensive damage in central america and cuba jamaica edit as the precursor tropical wave to michelle drifted through the western caribbean sea it produced torrential rainfall on the island of jamaica causing widespread flooding 1 several residences on annotto bay and port maria were flooded as a result 163 evacuees sought shelter in locations in annotto bay in portland a shelter was opened for effected populations 21 in the same parish six homes were swept away from their foundations 22 in the parishes of saint catherine saint andrew and saint ann several roads were blocked by debris the jamaican national works agency  nwa worked to clear the road debris 21 the blocked roads isolated seven jamaican villages for an extended period of time 23 after tropical cyclogenesis michelle passed to the northwest of jamaica producing additional rainfall in a 48-hour period beginning on october 29 a location measured 41.65 inches 1,058 mm denoting an average rainfall rate of 0.86 inches 22 mm per hour 24 many other locations reported high rainfall totals over a ten-day period throughout michelle s passage near jamaica 1 near spur tree hill an oil spill resulted from the flooding roads that were previously cleaned of debris a few days prior were covered again by the additional rainfall the rains also disrupted the country s communication and electrical grid leaving 6,000 homes without power in affected regions the widespread power outages in conjunction with invasive floodwaters also caused the cessation of 31 water plants run by the national water commission overall 30 homes were destroyed by flooding caused by michelle as it passed to the northwest extensive damage was reported to small livestock bananas plantains vegetables and coffee 25 coffee crops were severely affected in portland and saint andrew parishes with losses calculated at j 102.6 million us 2.2 million roughly 400 ac 200 ha of banana plantations were damaged

livestock were estimated at j 30.8 million us 670,000 26 overall floods caused widespread damage throughout jamaica the watersheds of the spanish and swift rivers were the worst affected areas near the coast the rivers began to overflow due to excess floodwater eroding beach roads and three major highways in portland parish the rains caused numerous landslides in the community of bybrook alone it was estimated that roughly 7,000,000 ft3 200,000 m3 of material was deposited in the village an assessment of the damage concluded that 500 homes were destroyed beyond repair while an additional 561 homes were at least damaged by the floods and heavy rain while one school was damaged solely by the floods six other schools were damaged due to their use as shelters 26 damage on jamaica due to michelle totaled 18 million 27 of which 11.8 million was due to crop and livestock losses damage to bridges alone totaled j 143.7 million us 3.1 million five fatalities were also confirmed 26 and 340 people were displaced from their homes 27 central america edit tropical depression fifteen affecting central america on october 30 in its early developmental stages as a tropical depression michelle drifted over areas of central america for roughly 36 hours dropping torrential rainfall and causing widespread flooding in areas affected by hurricane mitch almost exactly three years prior the hardest hit region was gracias a dios department in northeastern honduras where at one point 100 villages were isolated by the floods the torrential rainfall caused the displacement of at least 100,000 people from their residences 1 across central america over 27,300 people were evacuated from flooded areas 28 in honduras the floods damaged 245 homes resulting in the displacement of 4,393 people across the country six bridges sustained at least partial damage of which three were destroyed as a result of the damage the government of honduras declared a state of emergency for five departments – colón atlántida yoro cortés and santa bárbara 29 the floods caused by michelle were further exacerbated by a cold front which lingered over the region dropping additional rainfall 28 of the affected departments yoro was the most affected with no supply of drinkable water and electricity following the flooding 30 near yoro a bridge crossing the cuyamapa river collapsed due to the floodwaters 31 despite the heavy rainfall areas of honduras suffering from a prolonged drought did not receive beneficial rainfall 32 overall the floods in honduras killed 21 people and caused 5 million in damage 33 thirty-five of the country s water systems were destroyed the rains also caused the loss of 70 percent of bean crops 34 although the precursor to michelle remained stationary primarily over nicaragua damage was not as significant as in honduras due to the storm s displacement of convection to the north 1 nonetheless floods still isolated villages and other communities in the nicaraguan districts of bonaza rosita siuna puerto cabezas waspam and to a lesser extent prinzapolka in those areas roads and bridges were damaged and in some cases destroyed the heavy rains also damaged crops 30 due to the rains an estimated 6,000 people evacuated from their homes the port city of puerto cabezas was partially flooded 35 as a result of michelle a total of 16 deaths were confirmed and damage in the country was estimated at 1 million 33 in costa rica michelle caused anomalously high rainfall resulting in flooding 36 overall damage in costa rica totaled 1 million though no deaths were reported 33 cayman islands edit in early november hurricane michelle brought heavy surf storm surge and flooding to the cayman islands of the islands in the archipelago grand cayman experienced the worst effects from michelle particularly along the island s west coast rainfall peaked at 6.52 in 166 mm in grand cayman the same station recorded a peak wind gust of 44 mph 70 km h 1 the rains caused localized flooding in the western and southern portions of the island 37 another weather station in cayman brac observed a peak wind gust of 40 mph 65 km h 1 overall damage from the

assistance but accepted a proposal to purchase the goods instead although the united states has maintained an economic embargo on cuba for decades u.s law does allow shipments of food and medicine to the communist-controlled island but until now the cuban government has refused to buy american food because of the restrictions including a ban on direct u.s financing of food sales 61 other aid from

atlantic hurricane season with tropical activity before and after the official bounds of the season – the first such occurrence in 49 years the season produced 21 tropical cyclones of which 16 developed into named storms seven cyclones attained hurricane status of which three reached major hurricane status with sixteen storms the season was tied for the sixth most active atlantic hurricane season on record the strongest hurricane of the season was hurricane isabel which reached category 5 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale northeast of the lesser antilles isabel later struck north carolina as a category 2 hurricane causing 3.6 billion in damage 2003 usd 4.69 billion 2017 usd and a total of 51 deaths across the mid-atlantic region of the united states the season began with subtropical storm ana on april 20 prior to the official start of the season the bounds of the season are from june 1 to november 30 which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic basin in early september hurricane fabian struck bermuda as a category 3 hurricane where it was the worst hurricane since 1926 on the island it caused four deaths and 300 million in damage 2003 usd 391 million 2017 usd hurricane juan caused considerable destruction to nova scotia particularly halifax as a category 2 hurricane the first hurricane of significant strength to hit the province since 1893 additionally hurricanes claudette and erika struck texas and mexico respectively as minimal hurricanes seasonal forecasts edit

of above normal activity the forecasters predicted 11–15 tropical storms 6–9 of those becoming hurricanes and 2–4 of those hurricanes reaching at least category 3 strength on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the above normal activity predicted was due to the likelihood of la niña developing in the season 2 noted hurricane expert dr william m gray on april 4 predicted twelve named storms with eight reaching hurricane strength and three of the eight reaching category 3 strength 3 the prediction issued on may 30 was similar increasing the named storms to fourteen the synoptic pattern of the season prior to june 1 resembled other previous seasons with the 1952 1954 1964 1966 and 1998 seasons considered the best analogs for the season the prediction also included a 68  probability for a hurricane landfall along the united states 4 mid-season outlook edit on august 6 dr gray announced he had maintained his previous prediction with an active start of the season the rest of the season was forecast to have been only slightly above average due to an anticipated overall less favorable environment across the atlantic ocean 5 a day later noaa released an updated prediction as well with a 60 probability of above normal activity with 12–15 named storms 7–9 hurricanes and 3–4 major hurricanes expected 6 a normal season as defined by noaa has 6–14 tropical storms 4–8 of which reach

2003 8 though subtropical storm ana formed on april 20 well before the start to the season 9 starting at the official start of the season the national hurricane center began issuing five-day forecasts extending from the three-day forecasts issued since 1964 officials conducted tests during the previous two seasons indicating the new five-day forecasts would be as accurate as the three-day forecasts were 15 years earlier 10 the tropics were active and well ahead of climatology in the early portion of the season with the seventh tropical depression forming by the end of july 11 the season officially ended on november 30 2003 8 although tropical storms odette and peter developed in early december 12 13 the season is one of only six with a storm before and after the official bounds of the season the others are 1887 1951 1953 1954 and 2007 when tropical storm peter formed on december 7 the season became the second on record with two december storms the 235 days between the development of the first storm tropical storm ana and the dissipation of the last storm peter made the 2003 season the longest season since 1952 the season was the eighth most active on record behind the 2005 1933 2012 2011 2010 1995 1887 and 1969 seasons and tied with the 1936 and 2008 seasons 14 no cyclones in the season had a significant impact on south america or central america however a total of eight tropical cyclones made landfall on mexico from either the atlantic or the pacific ocean which was the greatest total since the record of nine in 1971 a total of seven deaths occurred in mexico from atlantic hurricanes much of the caribbean did not receive significant impact from tropical cyclones during the season 15 damage from hurricane fabian on bermuda six tropical cyclones made landfall along the coast of the united states during the season including two hurricanes the first claudette caused locally heavy damage in southeastern texas in july two deaths were reported in the state while earlier in its duration it caused an indirect death from rough waves in florida 16 in september hurricane isabel caused deaths and damage from north carolina through southern canada 17 the worst damage from the hurricane occurred in virginia where it was the costliest disaster in the history of the state 18 there damage totaled 1.85 billion 2003 usd 2.41 billion 2017 usd and there were 32 fatalities ten of which were caused directly by the hurricane 17 hurricane isabel caused deaths in seven states and one canadian province and about 6 million people were left without power as a result of the storm 19 several cyclones impacted bermuda during the season most significantly hurricane fabian on the island its passage proved to be the costliest and resulted in the first death since a hurricane in 1926 20 the hurricane killed four on the island when its strong waves and storm surge washed two cars off the causeway between st george s parish and st david s island 21 damage from the hurricane totaled 300 million 2003 usd 391 million 2017 usd 22 elsewhere hurricane juan was considered among the most damaging in the history of halifax nova scotia where strong winds downed thousands of trees and left low-lying areas flooded from a record storm surge to the city the hurricane caused a total of eight deaths and damage estimated at 200 million 2003 cad 150 million 2003 usd

east-southeastward and organized and on april 21 it transitioned into a tropical cyclone with peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h after developing an upper-level warm core increased wind shear caused fluctuations in intensity and a steady weakening trend and on april 24 the center of ana merged with an approaching cold front thus signaling the completion of extratropical transition the extratropical remnants continued east-northeastward and on april 27 the gale was absorbed within the cold front 9 the cyclone is most notable for being the only atlantic tropical cyclone in the month of april until tropical storm arlene in 2017 when ana became a subtropical storm it became the second subtropical cyclone on record in the month after a storm in 1992 9 ana dropped 2.63 in 67 mm of

weakening and hitting puerto morelos on the yucatán peninsula on july 11 as a tropical storm the storm remained disorganized due to moderate wind shear though after turning west-northwestward into an area of lighter shear it re-attained hurricane status on july 15 off the coast of texas it intensified quickly and made landfall on matagorda island with peak winds of 90 mph 145 km h it slowly

tracking around the periphery of an anticyclone the storm moved northwestward before turning north and later northeastward despite being located at a high latitude danny continued to strengthen due to unusually warm water temperatures and on july 19 it attained hurricane status about 525 mi 850 km south of st john s newfoundland and labrador despite having an unusually high minimum pressure for a storm of its intensity 41 wind shear increased the next day as the hurricane turned eastward causing a steady weakening trend that was accelerated after crossing into an area of cooler water temperatures by july 20 the cyclone had turned to the southeast and weakened to tropical depression status and on july 21 it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area the remnants of danny tracked

bands to its north and south and was originally forecast to attain hurricane status before passing through the lesser antilles with warm waters and very light wind shear forecast its environmental conditions met four out of five parameters for rapid intensification 44 subsequently convection diminished as the result of cold air inflow and instability from a disturbance to its southeast 45 with

through the bahamas and while crossing florida a circulation built toward the surface it is estimated the system developed into tropical storm erika on august 14 about 85 mi 140 km west-southwest of fort myers florida a strong ridge caused the storm to continue quickly westward and the system gradually strengthened and organized by august 15 its forward motion slowed allowing the convection to organize into curved rainbands and late in the day an eye feature began developing tropical storm erika attained hurricane status at around 1030 utc as it was moving ashore in northeastern tamaulipas operationally it was not classified as a hurricane due to lack of data the winds rapidly decreased as it tracked across the mountainous terrain of northeastern mexico and early on august 17 the

to the north nicholas transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on october 24 as an extratropical storm nicholas executed a large loop to the west and after moving erratically for a week and organizing into a tropical low it was absorbed by a non-tropical low the low continued westward crossed florida and ultimately dissipated over the gulf coast of the united states on november 5 104 nicholas had no impact as a tropical cyclone and impact from the low that absorbed the storm was limited to rainfall gusty winds and rough surf 105 the low that absorbed the storm nearly developed into a tropical

anticipate strengthening 109 however peter intensified to winds of 70 mph 110 km h late on december 9 after an eye feature developed usually that would indicate hurricane intensity but as the eye was short-lived peter remained a tropical storm it turned northward ahead of the same frontal system that absorbed tropical storm odette and the combination of strong upper-level winds and cooler water temperatures caused quick weakening by december 10 peter degenerated into a tropical depression and after turning northeastward it was absorbed by the cold front the next day 13 season effects edit

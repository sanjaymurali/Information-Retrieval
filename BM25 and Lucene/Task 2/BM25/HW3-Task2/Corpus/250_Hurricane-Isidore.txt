islands cuba yucatán peninsula louisiana mississippi part of the 2002 atlantic hurricane season hurricane isidore was the ninth named storm and the second hurricane in the 2002 atlantic hurricane season isidore was the fifth of eight named storms to occur in september 1 the tropical cyclone peaked as a category 3 hurricane causing damage as well as four fatalities in jamaica cuba mexico and the united states 2 isidore is noted for threatening to strike the northern gulf coast as a category 4 hurricane but instead striking as a moderate tropical storm due to a track change that brought the storm over the yucatán peninsula for over a day which significantly weakened the cyclone its primary impact was the heavy rainfall which fell across southeast mexico and from the central united states gulf coast into the ohio valley 3 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on september 9 a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa despite moving through a dry environment its convection became organized as an anticyclone developed over the wave on september 14 convection was well-organized enough around a small closed wind circulation to classify the system as tropical depression ten near trinidad and tobago 2 land interaction from venezuela later weakened the depression back to a tropical wave the wave continued west-northwestward through the caribbean and redeveloped into a tropical depression on september 17 while 140 miles 230 km south of jamaica 4 embedded within a weak steering current it drifted to the northwest and strengthened into tropical storm isidore on september 18 near jamaica 5 after grazing the island it quickly intensified to a hurricane late on september 19 while south of cuba isidore s maximum sustained winds reached 100 miles per hour 160 km h near the isle of youth and weakened slightly to an 85 miles per hour 137 km h hurricane as it made landfall on cabo frances late on september 20 1 the hurricane crossed the island then slowed as it moved westward across the gulf of mexico favorable conditions aloft with warm water temperatures allowed isidore to quickly intensify to a peak of 125 miles per hour 201 km h winds on september 21 6 despite dvorak satellite estimates of 145 miles per hour 233 km h reconnaissance aircraft indicated isidore remained a 125 miles per hour 201 km h category 3 hurricane with pressures dropping to 934 mbar 27.6 inhg typical of a category 4 hurricane 7 it is the lowest minimum pressure ever observed for an atlantic hurricane which did not exceed category 3 intensity 1 with nearly ideal conditions for development isidore was forecast to reach winds of 150 miles per hour 240 km h over the northern gulf of mexico 8 high pressures to its north forced it southward and isidore made landfall at telchac puerto in yucatán as a major hurricane on september 22 it weakened rapidly as it nearly stalled over yucatán and was only a minimal tropical storm after being inland for 30 hours tropical storm isidore left lili middle and kyle on september 25 the inner core of convection collapsed while over southeast mexico and upon moving northward and reaching the gulf of mexico again it was a large but weak tropical storm conditions favored significant strengthening but isidore did not redevelop central convection until reaching the northern gulf of mexico the strengthening system hit grand isle louisiana on september 26 as a 65 miles per hour 105 km h tropical storm but weakened quickly into a tropical depression after moving inland the system raced to the northeast and became an extratropical cyclone on september 27 before becoming absorbed in a frontal zone over pennsylvania that night 9 preparations edit tropical storm isidore making landfall in louisiana on september 26 before isidore became a hurricane there were fears that the storm would end up being a significant threat 2 the upper level environment ahead of the storm was very favorable and the oceanic heat content was very high 10 just ten months after the destructive hurricane michelle hurricane isidore threatened to cause similar effects in cuba in preparation for the storm about 292,000 people and thousands of farm animals were evacuated in the pinar del río province 11 12 hurricane warnings were posted about 48 hours before landfall leaving ample time to prepare for the storm once in the gulf of mexico hurricane isidore became a major category 3 storm with winds of 125 miles per hour 201 km h 1 the forecasts then predicted isidore to move westward in the gulf of mexico for a few days before turning northward towards the gulf coast as what was predicted by then to be a strong category 4 hurricane 13 initially expected to remain north of the peninsula hurricane warnings were issued just over a day prior to landfall with no watch preceding isidore s passage 14 15 more than 70,000 people were evacuated 16 and ports on the gulf coast of yucatán were closed mexican authorities declared a state of emergency prior to the arrival of the storm 17 due to isidore s unexpected southward turn into the yucatán peninsula isidore weakened significantly to a tropical storm which limited potential damage along the united states gulf coast in preparation for the hurricane the red cross mobilized its members across texas alabama louisiana mississippi and florida days before isidore s expected landfall 16 volunteers were sent in the days prior to ensure families had a family disaster plan and a disaster supplies kit in their household hurricane watches raised for the united states gulf coast between cameron louisiana and pascagoula mississippi late on the morning of september 24 were discontinued early on the morning of september 25 when the storm was no longer expected to restrengthen into a hurricane 5 impact edit caribbean islands edit in the windward islands isidore was a weak tropical

retired south pacific cyclone names outline of tropical cyclones tropical cyclones portal v t e tropical cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of a tropical cyclone in the atmosphere 1 the mechanisms through which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those through which mid-latitude cyclogenesis occurs tropical cyclogenesis involves the development of a warm-core cyclone due to significant convection in a favorable atmospheric environment 2 there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a preexisting low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear 3 tropical cyclones tend to develop during the summer but have been noted in nearly every month in most basins climate cycles such as enso and the madden–julian oscillation modulate the timing and frequency of tropical cyclone development 4 5 there is a limit on tropical cyclone intensity which is strongly related to the water temperatures along its path 6 an average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide of those 47 reach hurricane typhoon strength and 20 become intense tropical cyclones at least category 3 intensity on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale 7 requirements for tropical cyclone formation edit depth of 26 °c isotherm on october 1 2006 there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to sustain a low pressure center a preexisting low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear 3 while these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form 3 warm waters instability and mid-level moisture edit main article lapse rate waves in the trade winds in the atlantic ocean—areas of converging winds that move slowly along the same track as the prevailing wind—create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes normally an ocean temperature of 26.5 °c 79.7 °f spanning through at least a 50-metre depth is considered the minimum to maintain a tropical cyclone 3 these warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems this value is well above 16.1 °c 60.9 °f the global average surface temperature of the oceans 8 tropical cyclones are known to form even when normal conditions are not met for example cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude e.g. at the 500 hpa level or 5.9 km can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection in a moist atmosphere this lapse rate is 6.5 °c km while in an atmosphere with less than 100 relative humidity the required lapse rate is 9.8 °c km 9 at the 500 hpa level the air temperature averages −7 °c 18 °f within the tropics but air in the tropics is normally dry at this level giving the air room to wet-bulb or cool as it moistens to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection a wetbulb temperature at 500 hpa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2 °c is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5 °c and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1 °c in the sea surface temperature for each 1 °c change at 500 hpa under a cold cyclone 500 hpa temperatures can fall as low as −30 °c which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres this also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere roughly at the 500 hpa level is normally a requirement for development however when dry air is found at the same height temperatures at 500 hpa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres 10 11 at heights near the tropopause the 30-year average temperature as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990 was −77 °c −105 °f 12 a recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was epsilon of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season 13 role of maximum potential intensity mpi edit kerry emanuel created a mathematical model around 1988 to compute the upper limit of tropical cyclone intensity based on sea surface temperature and atmospheric profiles from the latest global model runs emanuel s model is called the maximum potential intensity or mpi maps created from this equation show regions where tropical storm and hurricane formation is possible based upon the thermodynamics of the atmosphere at the time of the last model run this does not take into account vertical wind shear 14 schematic representation of flow around a low-pressure area in this case hurricane isabel in the northern hemisphere the pressure gradient force is represented by blue arrows the coriolis acceleration always perpendicular to the velocity by red arrows coriolis force edit main article coriolis force a minimum distance of 500 km 310 mi from the equator is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis 3 the coriolis force imparts rotation on the flow and arises as winds begin to flow in toward the lower pressure created by the pre-existing disturbance in areas with a very small or non-existent coriolis force e.g near the equator the only significant atmospheric forces in play are the pressure gradient force the pressure difference that causes winds to blow from high to low pressure 15 and a smaller friction force these two alone would not cause the large-scale rotation required for tropical cyclogenesis the existence of a significant coriolis force allows the developing vortex to achieve gradient wind balance 16 this is a balance condition found in mature tropical cyclones that allows latent heat to concentrate near the storm core this results in the maintenance or intensification of the vortex if other development factors are neutral 17 low level disturbance edit whether it be a depression in the intertropical covergence zone itcz a tropical wave a broad surface front or an outflow boundary a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis 3 even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low 3 tropical cyclones can form when smaller circulations within the intertropical convergence zone merge 18 weak vertical wind shear edit main article wind shear vertical wind shear of less than 10 m s 20 kt 22 mph between the surface and the tropopause is favored for tropical cyclone development 3 a weaker vertical shear makes the storm grow faster vertically into the air which helps the storm develop and become stronger if the vertical shear is too strong the storm cannot rise to its full potential and its energy becomes spread out over too large of an area for the storm to strengthen 19 strong wind shear can blow the tropical cyclone apart 20 as it displaces the mid-level warm core from the surface circulation and dries out the mid-levels of the troposphere halting development in smaller systems the development of a significant mesoscale convective complex in a sheared environment can send out a large enough outflow boundary to destroy the surface cyclone moderate wind shear can lead to the initial development of the convective complex and surface low similar to the mid-latitudes but it must relax to allow tropical cyclogenesis to continue 21 favorable trough interactions edit limited vertical wind shear can be positive for tropical cyclone formation when an upper-level trough or upper-level low is roughly the same scale as the tropical disturbance the system can be steered by the upper level system into an area with better diffluence aloft which can cause further development weaker upper cyclones are better candidates for a favorable interaction there is evidence that weakly sheared tropical cyclones initially develop more rapidly than non-sheared tropical cyclones although this comes at the cost of a peak in intensity with much weaker wind speeds and higher minimum pressure 22 this process is also known as baroclinic initiation of a tropical cyclone trailing upper cyclones and upper troughs can cause additional outflow channels and aid in the intensification process it should be noted that developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance cyclone 23 24 there are cases where large mid-latitude troughs can help with tropical cyclogenesis when an upper-level jet stream passes to the northwest of the developing system which will aid divergence aloft and inflow at the surface spinning up the cyclone this type of interaction is more often associated with disturbances already in the process of recurvature 25 times of formation edit peaks of activity worldwide worldwide tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer when water temperatures are warmest each basin however has its own seasonal patterns on a worldwide scale may is the least active month while september is the most active 26 in the north atlantic a distinct hurricane season occurs from june 1 through november 30 sharply peaking from late august through october 26 the statistical peak of the north atlantic hurricane season is september 10 27 the northeast pacific has a broader period of activity but in a similar time frame to the atlantic 26 the northwest pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round with a minimum in february and a peak in early september 26 in the north indian basin storms are most common from april to december with peaks in may and november 26 in the southern hemisphere tropical cyclone activity generally begins in early november and generally ends on april 30 southern hemisphere activity peaks in mid-february to early march 26 virtually all the southern hemisphere activity is seen from the southern african coast eastward toward south america tropical cyclones are rare events across the south atlantic ocean and the southeastern pacific ocean 28 season lengths and averages basin season start season end tropical cyclones refs north atlantic june 1

in the temperate subtropics during the 2012 atlantic season middle latitudes edit areas farther than 30 degrees from the equator except in the vicinity of a warm current are not normally conducive to tropical cyclone formation or strengthening and areas more than 40 degrees from the equator are often very hostile to such development the primary limiting factor is water temperatures although higher shear at increasing latitudes is also a factor these areas are sometimes frequented by cyclones moving poleward from tropical latitudes on rare occasions such as alex in 2004 33 alberto in 1988 34 and the 1975 pacific northwest hurricane 35 storms may form or strengthen in this region typically tropical cyclones will undergo extratropical transition after recurving polewards and typically become fully extratropical after reaching 45–50˚ of latitude the majority of extratropical cyclones tend to restrengthen after completing the transition period 36 near the equator edit main article list of near-equatorial tropical cyclones areas within approximately ten degrees latitude of the equator do not experience a significant coriolis force a vital ingredient in tropical cyclone formation 37 however recently a few tropical cyclones have been observed forming within five degrees of the equator 38 south atlantic edit main article south atlantic tropical cyclone a combination of wind shear and a lack of tropical disturbances from the intertropical convergence zone itcz makes it very difficult for the south atlantic to support tropical activity 39 40 over four tropical cyclones have been observed here such as— a weak tropical storm in 1991 off the coast of africa near angola hurricane catarina which made landfall in brazil in 2004 at category 2 strength and a smaller storm in january 2004 east of salvador brazil the january storm is thought to have reached tropical storm intensity based on scatterometer wind measurements 41 mediterranean and black seas edit main article mediterranean tropical-like cyclone the cyclone katie over the extreme southeastern pacific waters in may 2015 storms that appear similar to tropical cyclones in structure sometimes occur in the mediterranean basin examples of these mediterranean tropical cyclones formed in september 1947 september 1969 september 1973 august 1976 january 1982 september 1983 december 1984 december 1985 october 1994 january 1995 october 1996 september 1997 december 2005 september 2006 november 2011 and november 2014 however there is debate on whether these storms were tropical in nature 42 the black sea has on occasion produced or fueled storms that begin cyclonic rotation and that appear to be similar to cyclones seen in the mediterranean 43 elsewhere edit tropical cyclogenesis is rare in the southeastern pacific ocean due to the cold sea-surface temperatures generated by the humboldt current and to unfavourable wind shear there are no records of a tropical cyclone hitting western south america but in mid-2015 a rare subtropical cyclone was identified in early may relatively close to chile this system was unofficially dubbed katie by researchers 44 vortices have been reported off the coast of morocco in the past however it is debatable if they are truly tropical in character 43 tropical activity is also extremely rare in the great lakes however a storm system that appeared similar to a subtropical or tropical cyclone formed in 1996 on lake huron it formed an eye-like structure in its center and it may have briefly been a subtropical or tropical cyclone 45 influence of large-scale climate cycles edit influence of enso edit loop of sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the tropical pacific main article el niño-southern oscillation warm waters during the el niño-southern oscillation lower the potential of tropical cyclone formation primarily in the atlantic basin and around australia 4 because tropical cyclones in the northeastern pacific and north atlantic basins are both generated in large part by tropical waves from the same wave train 46 decreased tropical cyclone activity in the north atlantic translates to increased tropical cyclone activity in the eastern north pacific 47 in the northwestern pacific el niño shifts the formation of tropical cyclones eastward during el niño episodes tropical cyclones tend to form in the eastern part of the basin between 150°e and the international date line idl 48 coupled with an increase in activity in the north-central pacific idl to 140°w and the south-central pacific east of 160°e there is a net increase in tropical cyclone development near the international date line on both sides of the equator 49 while there is no linear relationship between the strength of an el niño and tropical cyclone formation in the northwestern pacific typhoons forming during el niño years tend to have a longer duration and higher intensities 50 tropical cyclogenesis in the northwestern pacific is suppressed west of 150°e in the year following an el niño event 48 influence of the mjo edit 5-day running mean of mjo note how it moves eastward with time main article madden–julian oscillation in general westerly wind increases associated with the madden–julian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all basins as the oscillation propagates from west to east it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere s summer season 51 there is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western pacific basin and the north atlantic basin however when one basin is active the other is normally quiet and vice versa the main cause appears to be the phase of the madden–julian oscillation or mjo which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time 52 influence of equatorial rossby waves edit main article rossby wave research has shown that trapped equatorial rossby wave packets can increase the likelihood of tropical cyclogenesis in the pacific ocean as they increase the low-level westerly winds within that region which then leads to greater low-level vorticity the individual waves can move at approximately 1.8 m s 4 mph each though the group tends to remain stationary 53 seasonal forecasts edit since 1984 colorado state university has been issuing seasonal tropical cyclone forecasts for the north atlantic basin with results that are better than climatology 54 the university has found several statistical relationships for this basin that appear to allow long range prediction of the number of tropical cyclones since then numerous others have followed in the university s steps with some organizations issuing seasonal forecasts for the northwest pacific and the australian region 55 the predictors are related to regional oscillations in the global climate system the walker circulation which is related to the el niño-southern oscillation the north atlantic oscillation nao the arctic oscillation ao and the pacific north american pattern pna 54

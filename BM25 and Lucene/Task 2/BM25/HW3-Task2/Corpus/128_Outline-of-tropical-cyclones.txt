outline of tropical cyclones wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to tropical cyclones tropical cyclone – storm system characterized by a large low-pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain tropical cyclones strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated air rises resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air they are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as nor easters european windstorms and polar lows the characteristic that separates tropical cyclones from other cyclonic systems is that at any height in the atmosphere the center of a tropical cyclone will be warmer than its surroundings a phenomenon called warm core storm systems nature of tropical cyclones edit tropical cyclones can be described as all of the following storm – disturbed state of an environment or astronomical body s atmosphere especially affecting its surface and strongly implying severe weather it may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind hail thunder and lightning a thunderstorm heavy precipitation snowstorm rainstorm heavy freezing rain ice storm strong winds tropical cyclone windstorm or wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere such as sand or debris natural disaster – major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the earth examples include floods volcanic eruptions earthquakes tsunamis and other geologic processes a natural disaster can cause loss of life or property damage and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake the severity of which depends on the affected population s resilience or ability to recover types of tropical cyclones edit cumulative graph of tropical cyclones in the eastern pacific tropical cyclone – subtropical cyclone – extratropical cyclone – pacific hurricane – north atlantic hurricane – pacific typhoon – mediterranean tropical cyclone – annular hurricane – cape verde-type hurricane – tropical wave – tropical cyclone observations edit saffir–simpson scale category wind speeds five ≥70 m s ≥137 knots ≥157 mph ≥252 km h four 58–70 m s 113–136 knots 130–156 mph 209–251 km h three 50–58 m s 96–112 knots 111–129 mph 178–208 km h two 43–49 m s 83–95 knots 96–110 mph 154–177 km h one 33–42 m s 64–82 knots 74–95 mph 119–153 km h related classifications tropical storm 18–32 m s 34–63 knots 39–73 mph 63–118 km h tropical depression ≤17 m s ≤33 knots ≤38 mph ≤62 km h tropical cyclone scales – saffir-simpson hurricane scale – accumulated cyclone energy – hurricane severity index – carvill hurricane index – dvorak technique – tropical cyclone naming – forecasting edit regional specialized meteorological centre – canadian hurricane centre – central pacific hurricane center – eastern pacific hurricane center – joint typhoon warning center – joint typhoon warning center – tropical cyclone formation alert – tropical cyclone forecast model – tropical cyclone forecasting – tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting – tropical cyclone track forecasting – tropical cyclone warnings and watches – tropical cyclone history edit tropical cyclone seasons edit atlantic hurricane season pacific hurricane season pacific typhoon season north indian ocean tropical cyclone season south-west indian ocean tropical cyclone season australian region tropical cyclone season south pacific tropical cyclone season south atlantic tropical cyclone specific tropical cyclones edit hurricane isabel list of tropical cyclones lists of tropical cyclone names list of named tropical cyclones list of unnamed tropical cyclones list of historic tropical cyclone names list of retired tropical cyclone names list of tropical cyclone records list of wettest tropical cyclones by country list of wettest tropical cyclones in the united states list of most intense tropical cyclones list of atlantic hurricanes list of category 4 atlantic hurricanes list of category 5 atlantic hurricanes list of costliest atlantic hurricanes list of deadliest atlantic hurricanes list of atlantic hurricane records list of retired atlantic hurricane names list of off-season atlantic hurricanes list of atlantic–pacific crossover hurricanes list of pacific hurricanes list of retired pacific hurricane names list of retired pacific typhoon names jma list of category 5 pacific hurricanes

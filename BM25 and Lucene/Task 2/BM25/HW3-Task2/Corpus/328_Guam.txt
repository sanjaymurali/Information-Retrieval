in many legends about guam before european colonization the original inhabitants of guam and the northern mariana islands were the chamorro people who are believed to be descendants of austronesian people originating from southeast asia as early as 2000 bc 11 16 the ancient chamorro society had four classes chamorri chiefs matua upper class achaot middle class and mana chang lower class 11 20–21 the matua were located in the coastal villages which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds whereas the mana chang were located in the interior of the island matua and mana chang rarely communicated with each other and matua often used achaot as intermediaries there were also makåhna similar to shamans skilled in healing and medicine belief in spirits of ancient chamorros called taotao mo na still persists as a remnant of pre-european culture their society was organized along matrilineal clans 11 21 latte stones are stone pillars that are found only in the mariana islands they are a recent development in pre-contact chamorro society the latte-stone was used as a foundation on which thatched huts were built 11 26 latte stones consist of a base shaped from limestone

1521 during his fleet s circumnavigation of the globe 11 41–42 when magellan arrived on guam he was greeted by hundreds of small outrigger canoes that appeared to be flying over the water due to their considerable speed these outrigger canoes were called proas and resulted in magellan naming guam islas de las velas latinas islands of the lateen sails antonio pigafetta one of magellan s original 18 said that the name was island of sails but he also writes that the inhabitants entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on including the small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship 12 129 those people are poor but ingenious and very thievish on account of which we called those three islands islas de los ladrones islands of thieves 12 131 spanish colonization and the manila galleons edit despite magellan s visit guam was not officially claimed by spain until january 26 1565 by general miguel lópez de legazpi 11 46 from 1565 to 1815 guam and the northern

centuries of spanish rule 5 internal conflicts edit intermittent warfare lasting from july 23 1670 until july 1695 plus the typhoons of 1671 and 1693 and in particular the smallpox epidemic of 1688 reduced the chamorro population from 50,000 to 10,000 to less than 5,000 11 86 precipitated by the death of quipuha and the murder of father san vitores and pedro calungsod by local rebel chief matapang tensions led to a number of conflicts captain juan de santiago started a campaign to conquer the island which was continued by the successive commanders of the spanish forces 11 68–74 after

development projects started by his predecessors he also continued the search for the rebels who had assassinated father san vitores resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were hiding out in some islands eventually leading to the death of matapang hurao and aguarin 11 77–78 quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to guam ordering the population to live in a few large villages 11 78–79 these included jinapsan umatac pago agat and inarajan where he built a number of churches 11 79 by july 1695 quiroga had completed the conquest of guam rota tinian and aguigan 11 85

chamorros indigenous island people from the northern marianas who were brought to guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying japanese force the guamanian chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the japanese military after the war this would cause resentment between the guamanian chamorros and the chamorros of the northern marianas guam s chamorros believed

1980s and early 1990s there was a significant movement in favor of this u.s territory becoming a commonwealth which would give it a level of self-government similar to puerto rico and the northern mariana islands however the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of guam proposed because its clauses were incompatible with the territorial clause art iv sec

japan including the required construction workers this buildup would increase guam s population by 45 in a february 2010 letter the united states environmental protection agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs 46 by 2012 these plans had been cut to have only a maximum of 4,800 marines stationed on the island two thirds of whom would be there on a rotational basis without their dependents 47 with the proposed increased military presence stemming from the upcoming preparation efforts and relocation efforts of u.s marines

near the end of world war ii the brown tree snake boiga irregularis was accidentally introduced to guam which previously had no native species of snake it nearly eliminated the native bird population the problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island the brown tree snake known locally as the kulebla is native to northern and eastern coasts of australia papua new guinea and the solomon islands it is slightly venomous but relatively harmless to human beings it is nocturnal although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on guam residents rarely see them the united states department of agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island s cargo flow the united states geological survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region s islands 49 50 before the introduction of the brown tree snake guam was home to several endemic bird species among them were the guam rail or ko ko bird in chamorro and the guam flycatcher both common throughout the island today the flycatcher is entirely extinct and the guam rail is extinct in the wild but bred in captivity by the division of aquatic and wildlife resources the devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades as many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to extinction 51 according to many elders ko ko birds were common in guam before world war ii 52 other bird species threatened by the brown tree snake include the mariana crow the mariana swiftlet and the micronesian starling though populations are present on other islands including rota 51 guam is said to have many more insects and 40 times more spiders than neighboring islands because their natural predators birds are severely diminished and the forests are almost completely silent due to lack of birdsong 53 54 1 2 forest on guam swathed in spider webs coconut rhinoceros beetle edit coconut

significance herds of carabao obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems after birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective the u.s military began culling the herds in 2002 leading to organized protests from island residents 55 other introduced species include cane toads imported in 1937 the giant african snail an agricultural pest introduced during world war ii by japanese occupation troops and more recently frog species which could threaten crops in addition to providing additional food for the brown tree snake population reports of loud chirping frogs native to puerto rico and known as coquí that may have arrived from hawaii have led to fears that the noise could threaten guam s tourism 56 guam has no native amphibian species but now a total of eight amphibian species has been established in guam litoria fallax native to the eastern coast of australia has been present in guam since 1968 and rhinella marina the cane toad was brought to the island in 1937 the other 6 amphibian species namely hylarana guentheri native to mainland asia microhyla pulchra native to mainland asia polypedates braueri endemic to taiwan eleutherodactylus planirostris native to the caribbean fejervarya cancrivora the guam variety being most closely related to f cancrivora found in taiwan and fejervarya limnocharis native to southeast asia have been in guam since 2003 57 many species were likely inadvertently introduced via shipping cargo especially from taiwan mainland china and southeast asia introduced feral pigs and deer over-hunting and habitat loss from human development are also major factors in the decline and loss of guam s native plants and animals threats to indigenous plants edit invading animal species are not the only threat to guam s native flora tinangaja a virus affecting coconut palms was first observed on the island in 1917 when copra production was still a major part of guam s economy though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of guam 58 during the past century the dense forests of northern guam have been largely replaced by thick tangan-tangan brush leucaena leucocephala much of guam s foliage was lost during world war ii in 1947 the u.s military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent erosion tangan-tangan was present on the island before 1905 59 in southern guam non-native grass species dominate much of the landscape although the colorful and impressive flame tree delonix regia is found throughout the marianas the tree on guam has been largely decimated wildfires edit guam s grassland wildfires plague the forested areas of guam every dry season despite the island s humid climate most fires are caused by humans with 80 resulting from arson 60 poachers often start fires to attract deer to the new growth invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas grasslands and barrens have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion during the rainy season sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the fena lake reservoir and ugum river leading to water quality problems for southern guam eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers planting trees have had little success in preserving natural habitats 61 aquatic preserves edit having previously experienced extensive dredging tumon bay is now a marine wildlife preserve efforts have been made to protect guam s coral reef habitats from pollution eroded silt and overfishing problems that have led to decreased fish populations since guam is a significant vacation spot for scuba divers this is important in recent years the department of agriculture division of aquatic and wildlife resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists 62 before adopting u.s environmental protection agency standards portions of tumon bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel guests 63 64 tumon bay has since been made into a preserve a federal guam national wildlife refuge in northern guam protects the decimated sea turtle population in addition to a small colony of mariana fruit bats 65 harvest of sea turtle eggs was a common occurrence on guam before world war ii the green sea turtle chelonia mydas was harvested

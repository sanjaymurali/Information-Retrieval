vapor–liquid equilibrium wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia    redirected from saturated fluid jump to navigation search in thermodynamics and chemical engineering the vapor–liquid equilibrium vle describes the distribution of a chemical species between the gas phase and a liquid phase the concentration of a vapor in contact with its liquid especially at equilibrium is often expressed in terms of vapor pressure which will be a partial pressure a part of the total gas pressure if any other gas es are present with the vapor the equilibrium vapor pressure of a liquid is in general strongly dependent on temperature at vapor–liquid equilibrium a liquid with individual components in certain concentrations will have an equilibrium vapor in which the concentrations or partial pressures of the vapor components have certain values depending on all of the liquid component concentrations and the temperature the converse is also true if a vapor with components at certain concentrations or partial pressures is in vapor–liquid equilibrium with its liquid then the component concentrations in the liquid will be determined dependent on the vapor concentrations and on the temperature the equilibrium concentration of each component in the liquid phase is often different from its concentration or vapor pressure in the vapor phase but there is a relationship the vle concentration data can be determined experimentally or computed or approximated with the help of theories such as raoult s law dalton s law and henry s law such vapor–liquid equilibrium information is useful in designing columns for distillation especially fractional distillation which is a particular specialty of chemical engineers 1 2 3 distillation is a process used to separate or partially separate components in a mixture by boiling vaporization followed by condensation distillation takes advantage of differences in concentrations of components in the liquid and vapor phases in mixtures containing two or more components the concentrations of each component are often expressed as mole fractions the mole fraction of a given component of a mixture in a particular phase either the vapor or the liquid phase is the number of moles of that component in that phase divided by the total number of moles of all components in that phase binary mixtures are those having two components three-component mixtures are called ternary mixtures there can be vle data for mixtures with even more components but such data is often hard to show graphically vle data is a function of the total pressure such as 1 atm or whatever pressure the process is conducted at when a temperature is reached such that the sum of the equilibrium vapor pressures of the liquid components becomes equal to the total pressure of the system it is otherwise smaller then vapor bubbles generated from the liquid begin to displace the gas that was maintaining the overall pressure and the mixture is said to boil this temperature is called the boiling point of the liquid mixture at the given pressure it is assumed that the total pressure is held steady by adjusting the total volume of the system to accommodate the specific volume changes that accompany boiling the boiling point at an overall pressure of 1 atm is called the normal boiling point of the liquid mixture thermodynamic description of vapor–liquid equilibrium edit the field of thermodynamics describes when vapor–liquid equilibrium is possible and its properties much of the analysis depends on whether the vapor and liquid consist of a single component or if they are mixtures pure single-component systems edit if the liquid and vapor are pure in that they consist of only one molecular component and no impurities then the equilibrium state between the two phases is described by the following equations p l i q p v a p displaystyle p liq p vap t l i q t v a p displaystyle t liq t vap and g l i q g v a p displaystyle tilde g liq tilde g vap where p l i q displaystyle p liq and p v a p displaystyle p vap are the pressures within the liquid and vapor t l i q displaystyle t liq and t v a p displaystyle t vap are the temperatures within the liquid and vapor and g l i q displaystyle tilde g liq and g v a p displaystyle tilde g vap are the molar gibbs free energies units of energy per amount of substance within the liquid and vapor respectively 4 in other words the temperature pressure and molar gibbs free energy are the same between the two phases when they are at equilibrium an equivalent more common way to express the vapor–liquid equilibrium condition in a pure system is by using the concept of fugacity under this view equilibrium is described by the following equation f l i q t s p s f v a p t s p s displaystyle f liq t s p s f vap t s p s where f l i q t s p s displaystyle f liq t s p s and f v a p t s p s displaystyle f vap t s p s are the fugacities of the liquid and vapor respectively at the system temperature ts and pressure ps 5 using fugacity is often more convenient for calculation given that the fugacity of the liquid is to a good approximation pressure-independent 6 and it is often convenient to use the quantity ϕ f p displaystyle phi f p the dimensionless fugacity coefficient which is 1 for an ideal gas multicomponent systems edit in a multicomponent system where the vapor and liquid consist of more than one type of molecule describing the equilibrium state is more complicated for all components i in the system the equilibrium state between the two phases is described by the following equations p l i q p v a p displaystyle p liq p vap t l i q t v a p displaystyle t liq t vap and g ¯ i l i q g ¯ i v a p displaystyle bar g i liq bar g i vap where p and t are the temperature and pressure for each phase and g ¯ i l i q displaystyle bar g i liq and g ¯ i v a p displaystyle bar g i vap are the partial molar gibbs free energy also called chemical potential units of energy per amount of substance within the liquid and vapor respectively for each phase the partial molar gibbs free energy is defined by g ¯ i   d e f   ∂ g ∂ n i displaystyle bar g i stackrel mathrm def frac partial g partial n i where g is the extensive gibbs free energy and ni is the amount of substance of component i boiling-point diagrams edit binary mixture vle data at a certain overall pressure such as 1 atm showing mole fraction vapor and liquid concentrations when boiling at various temperatures can be shown as a two-dimensional graph called a boiling-point diagram the mole fraction of component 1 in the mixture can be represented by the symbol x1 the mole fraction of component 2 represented by x2 is related to x1 in a binary mixture as follows x1 x2 1 in multi-component mixtures in general with n components this becomes x1 x2 . xn 1 boiling-point diagram the preceding equilibrium equations are typically applied for each phase liquid or vapor individually but the result can be plotted in a single diagram in a binary boiling-point diagram temperature  t  is graphed vs x1 at any given temperature where both phases are present vapor with a certain mole fraction is in equilibrium with liquid with a certain mole fraction the two mole fractions often differ these vapor and liquid mole fractions are represented by two points on the same horizontal isotherm constant t  line when an entire range of temperatures vs vapor and liquid mole fractions is graphed two usually curved lines result the lower one representing the mole fraction of the boiling liquid at various temperatures is called the bubble point curve the upper one representing the mole fraction of the vapor at various temperatures is called the dew point curve 1 these two curves necessarily meet where the mixture becomes purely one component namely where x1 0 and x2 1 pure component 2 or x1 1 and x2 0 pure component 1 the temperatures at those two points correspond to the boiling points of each of the two pure components for certain pairs of substances the two curves also coincide at some point strictly between x1 0 and x1 1 when they meet they meet tangently the dew-point temperature always lies above the boiling-point temperature for a given composition when they are not equal the meeting point is called an azeotrope for that particular pair of substances it is characterized by an azeotrope temperature and an azeotropic composition often expressed as a mole fraction there can be maximum-boiling azeotropes where the azeotrope temperature is at a maximum in the boiling curves or minimum-boiling azeotropes where the azeotrope temperature is at a minimum in the boiling curves if one wants to represent a vle data for a three-component mixture as a boiling point diagram a three-dimensional graph can be used two of the dimensions would be used to represent the composition mole fractions and the third dimension would be the temperature using two dimensions the composition can be represented as an equilateral triangle in which each corner represents one of the pure components the edges of the triangle represent a mixture of the two components at each end of the edge any point inside the triangle represents the composition of a mixture of all three components the mole fraction of each component would correspond to where a point lies along a line starting at that component s corner and perpendicular to the opposite edge the bubble point and dew point data would become curved surfaces inside a triangular prism which connect the three boiling points on the vertical temperature axes each face of this triangular prism would represent a two-dimensional boiling-point diagram for the corresponding binary mixture due to their three-dimensional complexity such boiling-point diagrams are rarely seen alternatively the three-dimensional curved surfaces can be represented on a two-dimensional graph by the use of curved isotherm lines at graduated intervals similar to iso-altitude lines on a map two sets of such isotherm lines are needed on such a two-dimensional graph one set for the bubble point surface and another set for the dew point surface k values and relative volatility values edit main article relative volatility k values diagram with uniquac best-fit curve mixture of chloroform methanol the tendency of a given chemical species to partition itself preferentially between liquid and vapor phases is the henry s law constant there can be vle data for mixtures of four or more components but such a boiling-point diagram is hard to show in either tabular or graphical form for such multi-component mixtures as well as binary mixtures the vapor–liquid equilibrium data are represented in terms of k values vapor–liquid distribution ratios 1 2 defined by k i y i x i displaystyle k i frac y i x i where yi and xi are the mole fractions of component i in the phases y and x respectively for raoult s law k i p i ⋆ p displaystyle k i frac p i star p for modified raoult s law k i γ i p i ⋆ p displaystyle k i frac gamma i p i star p where γ i displaystyle gamma i is the activity coefficient pi is the partial pressure and p is the pressure the values of the ratio ki are correlated empirically or theoretically in terms of temperature pressure and phase compositions in the form of equations tables or graph such as the depriester charts shown on the right 7 k-values for systems of light hydrocarbons low temperature range k-values for systems of light hydrocarbons high temperature range for binary mixtures the ratio of the k values for the two components is called the relative volatility denoted by α α k i k j y i x i y j x j displaystyle alpha frac k i k j frac y i x i y j x j which is a measure of the relative ease or difficulty of separating the two components large-scale industrial distillation is rarely undertaken if the relative volatility is less than 1.05 with the volatile component being i and the less volatile component being j 2 k values are widely used in the design calculations of continuous distillation columns for distilling multicomponent mixtures vapor–liquid equilibrium diagrams edit vapor-liquid equilibrium diagram for each component in a binary mixture one could make a vapor–liquid equilibrium diagram such a diagram would graph liquid mole fraction on a horizontal axis and vapor mole fraction on a vertical axis in such vle diagrams liquid mole fractions for components 1 and 2 can be represented as x1 and x2 respectively and vapor mole fractions of the corresponding components are commonly represented as y1 and y2 2 similarly for binary mixtures in these vle diagrams x1 x2 1 and  y1 y2 1 such vle diagrams are square with a diagonal line running from the x1 0 y1 0 corner to the x1 1 y1 1 corner for reference these types of vle diagrams are used in the mccabe–thiele method to determine the number of equilibrium stages or theoretical plates needed to distill a given composition binary feed mixture into one distillate fraction and one bottoms fraction corrections can also be made to take into account the incomplete efficiency of each tray in a distillation column when compared to a theoretical plate raoult s law edit main article raoult s law at boiling and higher temperatures the sum of the individual component partial pressures becomes equal to the overall pressure which can symbolized as ptot under such conditions dalton s law would be in effect as follows ptot p1 p2 . then for each component in the vapor phase y1 p1   ptot,   y2 p2   ptot . etc where p1 partial pressure of component 1 p2 partial pressure of component 2 etc raoult s law is approximately valid for mixtures of components between which there is very little interaction other than the effect of dilution by the other components examples of such mixtures includes mixtures of alkanes which are non-polar relatively inert compounds in many ways so there is little attraction or repulsion between the molecules raoult s law states that for components 1 2 etc in a mixture p1 x1 p o1,   p2 x2 p o2 . etc where p o1 p o2 etc are the vapor pressures of components 1 2 etc when they are pure and x1 x2 etc are mole fractions of the corresponding component in the liquid recall from the first section that vapor pressures of liquids are very dependent on temperature thus the po pure vapor pressures for each component are a function of temperature t for example commonly for a pure liquid component the clausius–clapeyron relation may be used to approximate how the vapor pressure varies as a function of temperature this makes each of the partial pressures dependent on temperature also regardless of whether raoult s law applies or not when raoult s law is valid these expressions become p1t x1 p o1t,   p2t x2 p o2t . etc at boiling temperatures if raoult s law applies the total pressure becomes ptot x1 p o1t x2 p o2t . etc at a given ptot such as 1 atm and a given liquid composition t can be solved for to give the liquid mixture s boiling point or bubble point although the solution for t may not be mathematically analytical i.e. may require a numerical solution or approximation for a binary mixture at a given ptot the bubble point t can become a function of x1 or x2 and this function can be shown on a two-dimensional graph like a binary boiling point diagram at boiling temperatures if raoult s law applies a number of the preceding equations in this section can be combined to give the following expressions for vapor mole fractions as a function of liquid mole fractions and temperature y1 x1 p o1t   ptot,   y2 x2 p o2t   ptot . etc once the bubble point t s as a function of liquid composition in terms of mole fractions have been determined these values can be inserted into the above equations to obtain corresponding vapor compositions in terms of mole fractions when this is finished over a complete range of liquid mole fractions and their corresponding temperatures one effectively obtains a temperature  t function of vapor composition mole fractions this function effectively acts as the dew point t function of vapor composition in the case of a binary mixture x2 1 − x1 and the above equations can be expressed as y1 x1 p o1t   ptot and y2 1  −  x1  p o2t   ptot for many kinds of mixtures particularly where there is interaction between components beyond simply the effects of dilution raoult s law does not work well for determining the shapes of the curves in the boiling point or vle diagrams even in such mixtures there are usually still differences in the vapor and liquid equilibrium concentrations at most points and distillation is often still useful for separating components at least partially for such mixtures empirical data is typically used in determining such boiling point and vle diagrams chemical engineers have done a significant amount of research trying to develop equations for correlating and or predicting vle data for various kinds of mixtures which do not obey raoult s law well

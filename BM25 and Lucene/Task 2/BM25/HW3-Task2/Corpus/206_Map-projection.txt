map projection wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a medieval depiction of the ecumene 1482 johannes schnitzer engraver constructed after the coordinates in ptolemy s geography and using his second map projection a map projection is a systematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes of locations from the surface of a sphere or an ellipsoid into locations on a plane 1 maps cannot be created without map projections all map projections necessarily distort the surface in some fashion depending on the purpose of the map some distortions are acceptable and others are not therefore different map projections exist in order to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body at the expense of other properties there is no limit to the number of possible map projections 2 1 more generally the surfaces of planetary bodies can be mapped even if they are too irregular to be modeled well with a sphere or ellipsoid see below even more generally projections are a subject of several pure mathematical fields including differential geometry projective geometry and manifolds however map projection refers specifically to a cartographic projection background edit maps can be more useful than globes in many situations they are more compact and easier to store they readily accommodate an enormous range of scales they are viewed easily on computer displays they can facilitate measuring properties of the terrain being mapped they can show larger portions of the earth s surface at once and they are cheaper to produce and transport these useful traits of maps motivate the development of map projections however carl friedrich gauss s theorema egregium proved that a sphere s surface cannot be represented on a plane without distortion the same applies to other reference surfaces used as models for the earth since any map projection is a representation of one of those surfaces on a plane all map projections distort every distinct map projection distorts in a distinct way the study of map projections is the characterization of these distortions projection is not limited to perspective projections such as those resulting from casting a shadow on a screen or the rectilinear image produced by a pinhole camera on a flat film plate rather any mathematical function transforming coordinates from the curved surface to the plane is a projection few projections in actual use are perspective for simplicity most of this article assumes that the surface to be mapped is that of a sphere in reality the earth and other large celestial bodies are generally better modeled as oblate spheroids whereas small objects such as asteroids often have irregular shapes these other surfaces can be mapped as well therefore more generally a map projection is any method of flattening a continuous curved surface onto a plane metric properties of maps edit an albers projection shows areas accurately but distorts shapes many properties can be measured on the earth s surface independent of its geography some of these properties are area shape direction bearing distance scale map projections can be constructed to preserve at least one of these properties though only in a limited way for most each projection preserves or compromises or approximates basic metric properties in different ways the purpose of the map determines which projection should form the base for the map because many purposes exist for maps a diversity of projections have been created to suit those purposes another consideration in the configuration of a projection is its compatibility with data sets to be used on the map data sets are geographic information their collection depends on the chosen datum model of the earth different datums assign slightly different coordinates to the same location so in large scale maps such as those from national mapping systems it is important to match the datum to the projection the slight differences in coordinate assignation between different datums is not a concern for world maps or other vast territories where such differences get shrunk to imperceptibility which projection is best edit the mathematics of projection do not permit any particular map projection to be best for everything something will always be distorted therefore many projections exist to serve the many uses of maps and their vast range of scales modern national mapping systems typically employ a transverse mercator or close variant for large-scale maps in order to preserve conformality and low variation in scale over small areas for smaller-scale maps such as those spanning continents or the entire world many projections are in common use according to their fitness for the purpose 3 thematic maps normally require an equal area projection so that phenomena per unit area are shown in correct proportion 4 however representing area ratios correctly necessarily distorts shapes more than many maps that are not equal-area hence reference maps of the world often appear on compromise projections instead due to distortions inherent in any map of the world the choice of projection becomes largely one of aesthetics the mercator projection developed for navigational purposes has often been used in world maps where other projections would have been more appropriate 5 6 7 8 this problem has long been recognized even outside professional circles for example a 1943 new york times editorial states the time has come to discard the mercator for something that represents the continents and directions less deceptively . although its usage . has diminished . it is still highly popular as a wall map apparently in part because as a rectangular map it fills a rectangular wall space with more map and clearly because its familiarity breeds more popularity 2 166 a controversy in the 1980s over the peters map motivated the american cartographic association now cartography and geographic information society to produce a series of booklets including which map is best 9 designed to educate the public about map projections and distortion in maps in 1989 and 1990 after some internal debate seven north american geographic organizations adopted a resolution recommending against using any rectangular projection including mercator and gall–peters for reference maps of the world 10 11 distortion edit main article tissot s indicatrix tissot s indicatrices on the mercator projection the classical way of showing the distortion inherent in a projection is to use tissot s indicatrix for a given point using the scale factor h along the meridian the scale factor k along the parallel and the angle θ′ between them nicolas tissot described how to construct an ellipse that characterizes the amount and orientation of the components of distortion 2 147–149 12 by spacing the ellipses regularly along the meridians and parallels the network of indicatrices shows how distortion varies across the map construction of a map projection edit the creation of a map projection involves two steps selection of a model for the shape of the earth or planetary body usually choosing between a sphere or ellipsoid because the earth s actual shape is irregular information is lost in this step transformation of geographic coordinates longitude and latitude to cartesian x,y or polar plane coordinates in large-scale maps cartesian coordinates normally have a simple relation to eastings and northings defined as a grid superimposed on the projection in small-scale maps eastings and northings are not meaningful and grids are not superimposed some of the simplest map projections are literal projections as obtained by placing a light source at some definite point relative to the globe and projecting its features onto a specified surface this is not the case for most projections which are defined only in terms of mathematical formulae that have no direct geometric interpretation choosing a projection surface edit a miller cylindrical projection maps the globe onto a cylinder a surface that can be unfolded or unrolled into a plane or sheet without stretching tearing or shrinking is called a developable surface the cylinder cone and the plane are all developable surfaces the sphere and ellipsoid do not have developable surfaces so any projection of them onto a plane will have to distort the image to compare one cannot flatten an orange peel without tearing and warping it one way of describing a projection is first to project from the earth s surface to a developable surface such as a cylinder or cone and then to unroll the surface into a plane while the first step inevitably distorts some properties of the globe the developable surface can then be unfolded without further distortion aspect of the projection edit this transverse mercator projection is mathematically the same as a standard mercator but oriented around a different axis once a choice is made between projecting onto a cylinder cone or plane the aspect of the shape must be specified the aspect describes how the developable surface is placed relative to the globe it may be normal such that the surface s axis of symmetry coincides with the earth s axis transverse at right angles to the earth s axis or oblique any angle in between notable lines edit the developable surface may also be either tangent or secant to the sphere or ellipsoid tangent means the surface touches but does not slice through the globe secant means the surface does slice through the globe moving the developable surface away from contact with the globe never preserves or optimizes metric properties so that possibility is not discussed further here tangent and secant lines standard lines are represented undistorted if these lines are a parallel of latitude as in conical projections it is called a standard parallel the central meridian is the meridian to which the globe is rotated before projecting the central meridian usually written λ0 and a parallel of origin usually written φ0 are often used to define the origin of the map projection 13 14 scale edit further information map scale factor a globe is the only way to represent the earth with constant scale throughout the entire map in all directions a map cannot achieve that property for any area no matter how small it can however achieve constant scale along specific lines some possible properties are the scale depends on location but not on direction this is equivalent to preservation of angles the defining characteristic of a conformal map scale is constant along any parallel in the direction of the parallel this applies for any cylindrical or pseudocylindrical projection in normal aspect combination of the above the scale depends on latitude only not on longitude or direction this applies for the mercator projection in normal aspect scale is constant along all straight lines radiating from a particular geographic location this is the defining characteristic of an equidistant projection such as the azimuthal equidistant projection there are also projections maurer close where true distances from two points are preserved 2 234 choosing a model for the shape of the body edit projection construction is also affected by how the shape of the earth or planetary body is approximated in the following section on projection categories the earth is taken as a sphere in order to simplify the discussion however the earth s actual shape is closer to an oblate ellipsoid whether spherical or ellipsoidal the principles discussed hold without loss of generality selecting a model for a shape of the earth involves choosing between the advantages and disadvantages of a sphere versus an ellipsoid spherical models are useful for small-scale maps such as world atlases and globes since the error at that scale is not usually noticeable or important enough to justify using the more complicated ellipsoid the ellipsoidal model is commonly used to construct topographic maps and for other large and medium-scale maps that need to accurately depict the land surface auxiliary latitudes are often employed in projecting the ellipsoid a third model is the geoid a more complex and accurate representation of earth s shape coincident with what mean sea level would be if there were no winds tides or land compared to the best fitting ellipsoid a geoidal model would change the characterization of important properties such as distance conformality and equivalence therefore in geoidal projections that preserve such properties the mapped graticule would deviate from a mapped ellipsoid s graticule normally the geoid is not used as an earth model for projections however because earth s shape is very regular with the undulation of the geoid amounting to less than 100 m from the ellipsoidal model out of the 6.3 million m earth radius for irregular planetary bodies such as asteroids however sometimes models analogous to the geoid are used to project maps from 15 16 17 18 19 classification edit a fundamental projection classification is based on the type of projection surface onto which the globe is conceptually projected the projections are described in terms of placing a gigantic surface in contact with the earth followed by an implied scaling operation these surfaces are cylindrical e.g mercator conic e.g albers or azimuthal or plane e.g stereographic many mathematical projections however do not neatly fit into any of these three conceptual projection methods hence other peer categories have been described in the literature such as pseudoconic pseudocylindrical pseudoazimuthal retroazimuthal and polyconic another way to classify projections is according to properties of the model they preserve some of the more common categories are preserving direction azimuthal or zenithal a trait possible only from one or two points to every other point 20 preserving shape locally conformal or orthomorphic preserving area equal-area or equiareal or equivalent or authalic preserving distance equidistant a trait possible only between one or two points and every other point preserving shortest route a trait preserved only by the gnomonic projection because the sphere is not a developable surface it is impossible to construct a map projection that is both equal-area and conformal projections by surface edit the three developable surfaces plane cylinder cone provide useful models for understanding describing and developing map projections however these models are limited in two fundamental ways for one thing most world projections in actual use do not fall into any of those categories for another thing even most projections that do fall into those categories are not naturally attainable through physical projection as l.p lee notes no reference has been made in the above definitions to cylinders cones or planes the projections are termed cylindric or conic because they can be regarded as developed on a cylinder or a cone as the case may be but it is as well to dispense with picturing cylinders and cones since they have given rise to much misunderstanding particularly is this so with regard to the conic projections with two standard parallels they may be regarded as developed on cones but they are cones which bear no simple relationship to the sphere in reality cylinders and cones provide us with convenient descriptive terms but little else 21 lee s objection refers to the way the terms cylindrical conic and planar azimuthal have been abstracted in the field of map projections if maps were projected as in light shining through a globe onto a developable surface then the spacing of parallels would follow a very limited set of possibilities such a cylindrical projection for example is one which is rectangular has straight vertical meridians spaced evenly has straight parallels symmetrically placed about the equator has parallels constrained to where they fall when light shines through the globe onto the cylinder with the light source someplace along the line formed by the intersection of the prime meridian with the equator and the center of the sphere if you rotate the globe before projecting then the parallels and meridians will not necessarily still be straight lines rotations are normally ignored for the purpose of classification where the light source emanates along the line described in this last constraint is what yields the differences between the various natural cylindrical projections but the term cylindrical as used in the field of map projections relaxes the last constraint entirely instead the parallels can be placed according to any algorithm the designer has decided suits the needs of the map the famous mercator projection is one in which the placement of parallels does not arise by projection instead parallels are placed how they need to be in order to satisfy the property that a course of constant bearing is always plotted as a straight line cylindrical edit see also list of map projections § cylindrical the mercator projection shows rhumbs as straight lines a rhumb is a course of constant bearing bearing is the compass direction of movement the term normal cylindrical projection is used to refer to any projection in which meridians are mapped to equally spaced vertical lines and circles of latitude parallels are mapped to horizontal lines the mapping of meridians to vertical lines can be visualized by imagining a cylinder whose axis coincides with the earth s axis of rotation this cylinder is wrapped around the earth projected onto and then unrolled by the geometry of their construction cylindrical projections stretch distances east-west the amount of stretch is the same at any chosen latitude on all cylindrical projections and is given by the secant of the latitude as a multiple of the equator s scale the various cylindrical projections are distinguished from each other solely by their north-south stretching where latitude is given by φ north-south stretching equals east-west stretching sec φ the east-west scale matches the north-south scale conformal cylindrical or mercator this distorts areas excessively in high latitudes see also transverse mercator north-south stretching grows with latitude faster than east-west stretching sec2 φ the cylindric perspective or central cylindrical projection unsuitable because distortion is even worse than in the mercator projection north-south stretching grows with latitude but less quickly than the east-west stretching such as the miller cylindrical projection sec 4 5φ north-south distances neither stretched nor compressed 1 equirectangular projection or plate carrée north-south compression equals the cosine of the latitude the reciprocal of east-west stretching equal-area cylindrical this projection has many named specializations differing only in the scaling constant such as the gall–peters or gall orthographic undistorted at the 45° parallels behrmann undistorted at the 30° parallels and lambert cylindrical equal-area undistorted at the equator since this projection scales north-south distances by the reciprocal of east-west stretching it preserves area at the expense of shapes in the first case mercator the east-west scale always equals the north-south scale in the second case central cylindrical the north-south scale exceeds the east-west scale everywhere away from the equator each remaining case has a pair of secant lines—a pair of identical latitudes of opposite sign or else the equator at which the east-west scale matches the north-south-scale normal cylindrical projections map the whole earth as a finite rectangle except in the first two cases where the rectangle stretches infinitely tall while retaining constant width pseudocylindrical edit see also list of map projections § pseudocylindrical a sinusoidal projection shows relative sizes accurately but grossly distorts shapes distortion can be reduced by interrupting the map pseudocylindrical projections represent the central meridian as a straight line segment other meridians are longer than the central meridian and bow outward away from the central meridian pseudocylindrical projections map parallels as straight lines along parallels each point from the surface is mapped at a distance from the central meridian that is proportional to its difference in longitude from the central meridian therefore meridians are equally spaced along a given parallel on a pseudocylindrical map any point further from the equator than some other point has a higher latitude than the other point preserving north-south relationships this trait is useful when illustrating phenomena that depend on latitude such as climate examples of pseudocylindrical projections include sinusoidal which was the first pseudocylindrical projection developed on the map as in reality the length of each parallel is proportional to the cosine of the latitude 22 the area of any region is true collignon projection which in its most common forms represents each meridian as two straight line segments one from each pole to the equator tobler hyperelliptical mollweide goode homolosine eckert iv eckert vi kavrayskiy vii hybrid edit the healpix projection combines an equal-area cylindrical projection in equatorial regions with the collignon projection in polar areas conic edit albers conic the term conic projection is used to refer to any projection in which meridians are mapped to equally spaced lines radiating out from the apex and circles of latitude parallels are mapped to circular arcs centered on the apex 23 when making a conic map the map maker arbitrarily picks two standard parallels those standard parallels may be visualized as secant lines where the cone intersects the globe—or if the map maker chooses the same parallel twice as the tangent line where the cone is tangent to the globe the resulting conic map has low distortion in scale shape and area near those standard parallels distances along the parallels to the north of both standard parallels or to the south of both standard parallels are stretched distances along parallels between the standard parallels are compressed when a single standard parallel is used distances along all other parallels are stretched conic projections that are commonly used are equidistant conic which keeps parallels evenly spaced along the meridians to preserve a constant distance scale along each meridian typically the same or similar scale as along the standard parallels albers conic which adjusts the north-south distance between non-standard parallels to compensate for the east-west stretching or compression giving an equal-area map lambert conformal conic which adjusts the north-south distance between non-standard parallels to equal the east-west stretching giving a conformal map pseudoconic edit bonne werner cordiform upon which distances are correct from one pole as well as along all parallels american polyconic azimuthal projections onto a plane edit see also list of map projections § azimuthal an azimuthal equidistant projection shows distances and directions accurately from the center point but distorts shapes and sizes elsewhere azimuthal projections have the property that directions from a central point are preserved and therefore great circles through the central point are represented by straight lines on the map these projections also have radial symmetry in the scales and hence in the distortions map distances from the central point are computed by a function r d of the true distance d independent of the angle correspondingly circles with the central point as center are mapped into circles which have as center the central point on the map the mapping of radial lines can be visualized by imagining a plane tangent to the earth with the central point as tangent point the radial scale is r′ d and the transverse scale r d r sin d r where r is the radius of the earth some azimuthal projections are true perspective projections that is they can be constructed mechanically projecting the surface of the earth by extending lines from a point of perspective along an infinite line through the tangent point and the tangent point s antipode onto the plane the gnomonic projection displays great circles as straight lines can be constructed by using a point of perspective at the center of the earth r d c tan d r so that even just a hemisphere is already infinite in extent 24 25 the general perspective projection can be constructed by using a point of perspective outside the earth photographs of earth such as those from the international space station give this perspective the orthographic projection maps each point on the earth to the closest point on the plane can be constructed from a point of perspective an infinite distance from the tangent point r d c sin d r 26 can display up to a hemisphere on a finite circle photographs of earth from far enough away such as the moon approximate this perspective the stereographic projection which is conformal can be constructed by using the tangent point s antipode as the point of perspective r d c tan d 2r the scale is c 2r cos2 d 2r 27 can display nearly the entire sphere s surface on a finite circle the sphere s full surface requires an infinite map other azimuthal projections are not true perspective projections azimuthal equidistant r d cd it is used by amateur radio operators to know the direction to point their antennas toward a point and see the distance to it distance from the tangent point on the map is proportional to surface distance on the earth 28 for the case where the tangent point is the north pole see the flag of the united nations lambert azimuthal equal-area distance from the tangent point on the map is proportional to straight-line distance through the earth r d c sin d 2r 29 logarithmic azimuthal is constructed so that each point s distance from the center of the map is the logarithm of its distance from the tangent point on the earth r d c ln d d0 locations closer than at a distance equal to the constant d0 are not shown 30 31 comparison of some azimuthal projections centred on 90° n at the same scale ordered by projection altitude in earth radii click for detail projections by preservation of a metric property edit a stereographic projection is conformal and perspective but not equal area or equidistant conformal edit conformal or orthomorphic map projections preserve angles locally implying that they map infinitesimal circles of constant size anywhere on the earth to infinitesimal circles of varying sizes on the map in contrast mappings that are not conformal distort most such small circles into ellipses of distortion an important consequence of conformality is that relative angles at each point of the map are correct and the local scale although varying throughout the map in every direction around any one point is constant these are some conformal projections mercator rhumb lines are represented by straight segments transverse mercator stereographic any circle of a sphere great and small maps to a circle or straight line roussilhe lambert conformal conic peirce quincuncial projection adams

about 1997 for the winkel tripel compromise projections give up the idea of perfectly preserving metric properties seeking instead to strike a balance between distortions or to simply make things look

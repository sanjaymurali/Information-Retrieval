westerlies wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the westerlies blue and trade winds yellow the westerlies anti-trades 1 or prevailing westerlies are prevailing winds from the west toward the east in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees latitude they originate from the high-pressure areas in the horse latitudes and tend towards the poles and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner 2 tropical cyclones which cross the subtropical ridge axis into the westerlies recurve due to the increased westerly flow the winds are predominantly from the southwest in the northern hemisphere and from the northwest in the southern hemisphere the westerlies are strongest in the winter hemisphere and times when the pressure is lower over the poles while they are weakest in the summer hemisphere and when pressures are higher over the poles the westerlies are particularly strong especially in the southern hemisphere in areas where land is absent because land amplifies the flow pattern making the current more north-south oriented slowing the westerlies the strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes can come in the roaring forties between 40 and 50 degrees latitude the westerlies play an important role in carrying the warm equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse behavior edit see also polar cyclone and arctic oscillation if the earth were a non-rotating planet solar heating would cause winds across the mid-latitudes to blow in a poleward direction away from the subtropical ridge however the coriolis effect caused by the rotation of earth causes winds to steer to the right of what would otherwise be expected across the northern hemisphere and left of what would be expected in the southern hemisphere 3 this is why winds across the northern hemisphere tend to blow from the southwest but they tend to be from the northwest in the southern hemisphere 4 when pressures are lower over the poles the strength of the westerlies increases which has the effect of warming the mid-latitudes this occurs when the arctic oscillation is positive and during winter low pressure near the poles is stronger than it would be during the summer when it is negative and pressures are higher over the poles the flow is more meridional blowing from the direction of the pole towards the equator which brings cold air into the mid-latitudes 5 throughout the year the westerlies vary in strength with the polar cyclone as the cyclone reaches its maximum intensity in winter the westerlies increase in strength as the cyclone reaches its weakest intensity in summer the westerlies weaken 6 an example of the impact of the westerlies is when dust plumes originating in the gobi desert combine with pollutants and spread large distances downwind or eastward into north america 7 the westerlies can be particularly strong especially in the southern hemisphere where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the progression of west to east winds to slow down in the southern hemisphere because of the stormy and cloudy conditions it is usual to refer to the westerlies as the roaring forties furious fifties and shrieking sixties according to the varying degrees of latitude 8 impact on ocean currents edit benjamin franklin s map of the gulf stream due to persistent winds from west to east on the poleward sides of the subtropical ridges located in the atlantic and pacific oceans ocean currents are driven in a similar manner in both hemispheres the currents in the northern hemisphere are weaker than those in the southern hemisphere due to the differences in strength between the westerlies of each hemisphere 9 the process of western intensification causes currents on the western boundary of an ocean basin to be stronger than those on the eastern boundary of an ocean 10 these western ocean currents transport warm tropical water polewards toward the polar regions ships crossing both oceans have taken advantage of the ocean currents for centuries the antarctic circumpolar current acc or the west wind drift is an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica the acc is the dominant circulation feature of the southern ocean and at approximately 125 sverdrups the largest ocean current 11 in the northern hemisphere the gulf stream part of the north atlantic subtropical gyre has led to the development of strong cyclones of all types at the base of the westerlies both within the atmosphere and within the ocean 12 13 14 the kuroshio japanese for black tide is a strong western boundary current in the western north pacific ocean similar to the gulf stream which has also contributed to the depth of ocean storms in that region extratropical cyclones edit a fictitious synoptic chart of an extratropical cyclone affecting the uk and ireland the blue arrows between isobars indicate the direction of the wind while the l symbol denotes the centre of the low note the occluded cold and warm frontal boundaries main article extratropical cyclone an extratropical cyclone is a synoptic scale low pressure weather system that has neither tropical nor polar characteristics being connected with fronts and horizontal gradients in temperature and dew point otherwise known as baroclinic zones 15 the descriptor extratropical refers to the fact that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside of the tropics in the middle latitudes of the planet where the westerlies steer the system generally from west to east these systems may also be described as mid-latitude cyclones due to their area of formation or post-tropical cyclones where extratropical transition has occurred 15 16 and are often described as depressions or lows by weather forecasters and the general public these are the everyday phenomena which along with anti-cyclones drive the weather over much of the earth although extratropical cyclones are almost always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform along the radius from the center of low pressure 17 an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm and from there into a tropical cyclone if it dwells over warm waters and develops central convection which warms its core and causes temperature and dewpoint gradients near their centers to fade 18 interaction with tropical cyclones edit see also tropical cyclone storm track of hurricane bill 2009 showing a classic recurvature off the american coast in 2009 when a tropical cyclone crosses the subtropical ridge axis normally through a break in the high-pressure area caused by a system traversing the westerlies its general track around the high-pressure area is deflected significantly by winds moving towards the general low-pressure area to its north when the cyclone track becomes strongly poleward with an easterly component the cyclone has begun recurvature entering the westerlies 19 a typhoon moving through the pacific ocean towards asia for example will recurve offshore of japan to the north and then to the northeast if the typhoon encounters southwesterly winds blowing northeastward around a low-pressure system passing over china or siberia many tropical cyclones are eventually forced toward the northeast by extratropical cyclones in this manner which move from west to east to the north of the subtropical ridge an example of a tropical cyclone in recurvature was typhoon ioke in 2006 which took a similar trajectory 20

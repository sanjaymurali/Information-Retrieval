hurricane irene was a large and destructive tropical cyclone which affected much of the caribbean and east coast of the united states during late august 2011 irene is ranked as the ninth-costliest hurricane in united states history 2 the ninth named storm first hurricane and first major hurricane of the 2011 atlantic hurricane season irene originated from a well-defined atlantic tropical wave that began showing signs of organization east of the lesser antilles due to development of atmospheric convection and a closed center of circulation the system was designated as tropical storm irene on august 20 2011 after intensifying irene made landfall in st croix as a strong tropical storm later that day early on august 21 the storm made a second landfall in puerto rico while crossing the island irene strengthened into a category 1 hurricane the storm paralleled offshore of hispaniola continuing to slowly intensify in the process shortly before making four landfalls in the bahamas irene peaked as a 120 mph 190 km h category 3 hurricane thereafter the storm slowly leveled off in intensity as it struck the bahamas and then curved northward after passing east of grand bahama continuing to weaken irene was downgraded to a category 1 hurricane before making landfall on the outer banks of north carolina on august 27 becoming the first hurricane to make landfall in the united states since hurricane ike in 2008 early on the following day the storm re-emerged into the atlantic from southeastern virginia although irene remained a hurricane over water it weakened to a tropical storm while making yet another landfall in the little egg inlet in southeastern new jersey on august 27 a few hours later irene made its ninth and final landfall in brooklyn new york city early on august 29 irene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone hitting vermont after remaining inland as a tropical cyclone for less than 12 hours throughout its path irene caused widespread destruction and at least 56 deaths damage estimates throughout the united states are estimated near 15.6 billion 3 which made it the ninth-costliest hurricane in united states history only behind hurricane andrew of 1992 hurricane ivan of 2004 hurricanes wilma and katrina of 2005 hurricane ike of 2008 hurricane sandy in 2012 and hurricanes harvey irma and maria in 2017 in addition monetary losses in the caribbean and canada were 830 million and 130 million respectively for a total of nearly 16.6 billion in damage 4 5 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on august 15 2011 a tropical wave exited the west african coast and emerged into the atlantic characterized by distinct low-level cyclonic rotation and deep tropical humidity 6 it remained well-defined while moving steadily westward for several days to the south of the cape verde islands although at the time any notable convection occurred well to the southwest of its axis 7 as the wave distanced itself from the islands development of thunderstorms and showers in its proximity continued to remain scarce and it became rather broad in appearance 8 on august 19 the convective structure began to show signs of organization as the associated atmospheric pressure lowered and with a progressively favorable environment situated ahead of the wave its chances of undergoing tropical cyclogenesis markedly increased 9 10 the strong thunderstorm activity continued to become more pronounced around the main low-pressure feature by august 20 the national hurricane center noted that tropical cyclone formation was imminent as the wave neared the lesser antilles 11 and a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the presence of a small surface circulation center just southwest of a burst of vigorous convection and unusually high sustained winds indicating sufficient organization for the cyclone to be upgraded into tropical storm irene at 23 00 utc that day 12 irene was positioned about 190 mi 310 km east of dominica in the lesser antilles when it was classified and named along weakening high pressure over the west-central atlantic inducing a roughly west-northwestward path for most of its journey through the eastern caribbean 12 its mid-level circulation continued to become better established as hints of pronounced banding features curved north of the surface center 13 on august 21 the surface center reformed closer to the deepest convection furthermore an anticyclone aloft provided supportive outflow over the cyclone with the improved structure as well as light wind shear and high sea surface temperatures irene was forecast to strengthen to near hurricane force prior to landfall in hispaniola 14 15 over the subsequent day august 22 while passing near the island of saint croix in the u.s virgin islands 16 irene traced toward puerto rico more northward than initially expected where it underwent a considerable increase in strength and organization 17 hours later irene moved ashore approaching from the southeast at landfall near punta santiago humacao puerto rico with estimated sustained winds of 70 mph 110 km h 18 despite the storm s interaction with land radar imagery showed a ragged eye-like feature and doppler weather radar data indicated wind speeds in excess of hurricane force just after its initial landfall irene was accordingly upgraded to a category 1 hurricane the first of the 2011 atlantic hurricane season 19 play media loop showing irene s progress as viewed from the goes-east satellite with the hurricane then situated just north of the mountainous coast of hispaniola the storm deepened little after reemerging over water and any additional organization during the rest of the day was gradual 20 21 after briefly weakening on august 23 22 however irene began to develop a distinct eye encircled by an area of deepening convection the next morning moving erratically through the southeast bahamas over very warm waters 23 irene quickly expanded as its outflow aloft became very well established the cyclone intensified into a category 3 major hurricane as it recurved toward the northwest along a weakness in the subtropical ridge 24 the cyclone subsequently underwent a partial eyewall replacement cycle which resulted in some reduction in its winds although a distinct eye redeveloped for a few hours it obscured once again soon thereafter irene was unable to recover from the cycle with no further significant intensification expected thereafter 25 hurricane irene s remnants on august 30 in the process of being absorbed by another system early on august 27 irene further weakened to a category 1 hurricane as it approached the outer banks of north carolina 26 at 7 30 am edt 11 30 utc the same day irene made landfall near cape lookout on north carolina s outer banks with winds of 85 mph 137 km h but exhibited an unusually low pressure of 951 mbar which is typically found in a category 3 hurricane 27 after having tracked over land for about 10 hours the eye of irene became cloud-filled although the center remained well-defined on radar images 28 early in the evening of august 27 irene re-emerged into the atlantic near the southern end of the chesapeake bay in virginia as a marginal category 1 hurricane slowly weakening as it continued northward and weakening to a tropical storm early on august 28 29 shortly before sunrise at 5 35 am edt 0935 utc on august 28 irene made a second landfall at brigantine in southeastern new jersey with winds of 70 mph 110 km h 30 and soon after moved over water again hugging the new jersey coastline about 3 1 2 hours later tropical storm irene made landfall with 65 mph 105 km h winds in the coney island neighborhood of brooklyn new york following its final new york landfall irene moved northeast over new england while maintaining its strength before it was declared an extratropical cyclone early on august 29 while its center was located near the new hampshire vermont border 3 during that day the system continued to move towards the northeast before it was absorbed by a frontal system early on august 30 3 preparations edit caribbean edit in response to the formation of irene tropical storm warnings were issued for all of the leeward islands and puerto rico 31 also in the lesser antilles the storm s approach prompted authorities in the u.s virgin islands to close off air and seaports as well as to open public shelters 32 as irene was forecast to make landfall on hispaniola a tropical storm watch was initially issued for the south coast of the dominican republic though it was upgraded to a hurricane warning on august 21 after strengthening was forecast 33 in light of the expected intensification to hurricane status a tropical storm warning was also issued for the northern coast fire of that country while a tropical storm watch was put in effect for all of haiti the tropical storm warning for puerto rico was simultaneously upgraded to a hurricane watch 34 later that day all of the dominican republic was placed under a hurricane warning with the tropical storm watch for haiti upgraded to a warning and a tropical storm watch initiated for the southeastern bahamas and the turks and caicos islands 35 as irene s forecast track became justified the latter watch was upgraded to a warning on

showers spread over martinique though most of the activity occurred prior to development into a tropical cyclone 114 in spite of the center tracking just north of guadeloupe s island grande-terre the strongest effects were brought on by irene s outer rainbands tropical-storm-force winds generated brief rough seas with peak wave heights of no more than 18 ft 5.5 m accompanying intermittent torrents swept through much of the territory but overall rainfall was moderate precipitation totals of between 3.1 and 4.7 in 79 and 119 mm fell in basse-terre during the event 115 due to the storm conditions

accompanying storm surge affected roughly 200 homes and prompted evacuations along the northern coastlines 136 the strongest winds also occurred in northern cibao where they felled multiple trees and toppled utility poles swollen rivers creeks and streams caused widespread residential flooding and damage to roads saturated soil in the region triggered mudslides causing additional disruptions 137 despite its distance irene produced extreme rainfall in southern parts of the country that led to many secondary effects resultant floods combined with two overflown rivers swept through much of san

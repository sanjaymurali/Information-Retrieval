caused catastrophic damage throughout much of the islands of leyte where cities and towns were largely destroyed 53 as of april 17 2016 the national disaster risk reduction and management council ndrrmc confirmed 6,300 fatalities across the country 5,877 of those taking place in the eastern visayas 3 the true death toll remains unclear being claimed to be at least 10,000 by some victims from tacloban city leyte as of november 13 2015 the philippine red cross estimated that 22,000 people were missing in surigao city 281.9 mm 11.10 in of rainfall was recorded much of which fell in under 12 hours 54 storm surges were also recorded in many places in the island of leyte and samar pagasa measured 5–6 meter 15–19 ft waves 55 in tacloban leyte the terminal building of tacloban airport was destroyed by a 5.2 m 17 ft storm surge up to the height of the second story 56 along the airport a storm surge of 4 m 13 ft was estimated 57 waves of 4.6 m 15 ft were also estimated 58 on the western coast of samar the storm surge was not as significant 59 haiyan s first landfall was at guiuan in eastern samar where the typhoon touched down at 4 40am 60 61 nearly all structures in the township suffered at least partial damage many of which were completely flattened 62 for several days following haiyan s first landfall the damage situation in the fishing town remained unclear due to lack of communication in and out of the area 63 the damage could finally be assessed after philippine air force staff arrived in guiuan on november 10 64 prior to this a local priest was able to take his motorbike from guiuan to the towns of cabalogan and calbayog also in samar armed with photos of the devastation shot on his mobile phone 65 there was widespread devastation from the storm surge in tacloban city especially in san jose with many buildings being destroyed trees knocked over or broken and cars piled up 58 the low-lying areas on the eastern side of tacloban city were hardest hit

had been destroyed 53 journalists on the ground have described the devastation as off the scale and apocalyptic 66 most families in samar and leyte lost some family members or relatives families came in from outlying provinces looking for relatives especially children who may have been washed away 67 the entire first floor of the tacloban city convention center which was serving as an evacuation shelter was submerged by storm surge many residents in the building were caught off-guard by the fast rising waters and subsequently drowned or were injured in the building 68 although wind speeds were extreme the major cause of damage and loss of life appears to have been storm surge the major focus of devastation appears to have been on the east coast of samar and leyte with a particular focus on tacloban because of its location between samar and leyte and the large population in low-lying areas 59 philippine department of the interior and local government dilg secretary mar roxas said the scale of the relief operation that was now required was overwhelming with some places described as a wasteland of mud and debris 69 sebastian rhodes stampa head of a un disaster assessment co-ordination team said there was destruction on a massive scale in tacloban there are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris the last time i saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami 58 there is little communication in the city and no mobile phone coverage up the east coast of the leyte there are numerous towns and villages that are completely cut off without any assistance large parts of leyte and samar are without power and may have no power for a month 66 the storm crossed the visayas region for almost a day causing widespread flooding in cebu and bohol struck by a magnitude 7.2 earthquake two weeks before cities were also severely devastated 70 during the morning of november 8 media stations across the country were able to broadcast live the destruction of haiyan however before afternoon all communications on the visayas region failed the presidential communications department of president benigno aquino

in the philippines dr julie hall noted that while many survivors requiring medical attention in the first week suffer from trauma and fractures the concern shifts toward chronic conditions as the weeks pass the who coordinated the massive international response to help the philippine government meet the acute need for healthcare services in the affected areas 87 extreme damage to infrastructure throughout the region posed logistical problems that greatly slowed relief efforts though aid was flown into local airports most of it remained there as roads remained closed 88 according to estimates on november 13 only 20 percent of the affected population in tacloban city was receiving aid with lack of access to clean water some residents dug up water pipes and boiled water from there in order to survive thousands of people sought to evacuate the city via c-130 cargo planes however the slow process fueled further aggravation reports of escaped prisoners raping women in the city prompted a further urgency to evacuate one resident was quoted as saying tacloban is a dead city 53 due to the lack of electricity planes could only operate during the daylight further slowing the evacuations at dawn on november 12 thousands of people broke through fences and rushed planes only to be forced back by police and military personnel a similar incident occurred later that day as a u.s cargo plane was landing 89 on november 14 a correspondent from the bbc reported tacloban to be a war zone although the situation soon stabilized when the presence of government law enforcement was increased safety concerns prompted several relief agencies to back out of the operation and some united nations staff were pulled out for safety reasons a message circulating among the agencies urged them to not go into tacloban for this reason 90 on the west coast of leyte island residents in ormoc were fearing that the focus on tacloban city would leave them without aid though not as hard hit roughly 90 percent of the city was damaged or destroyed and supplies were running low hospitals in the city were either shut down or working at partial capacity leaving many of the nearly 2,000 injured in the city without medical assistance in nearby baybay lack of assistance fueled anger and incited looting for survival 91 in the coastal community guiuan which took the full brunt of the typhoon mayor christopher gonzalez is credited with saving countless lives after he incessantly urged residents to evacuate he referred to the storm as delubyo deluge which roughly translates to armageddon of the town s 45,000 residents 87 died 931 were injured and 23 others were listed as missing u.s navy capt russell hays a medical officer estimated that a storm of haiyan s caliber could have killed as many as 4,500 in guiuan alone had it not been for the mayor s efforts 92 on november 18 the government of the philippines launched an online portal called the foreign aid

haiyan s passage in some instances relief trucks were attacked and had food stolen in the city two of the city s malls and numerous grocery stores were subjected to looting a fuel depot in the city was guarded by armed police while 200 additional officers were dispatched to assist 102 security checkpoints had since been set up all over tacloban and a curfew was imposed on residents to prevent more attacks 103 philippine military forces also prevented members of the new people s army from ambushing a relief convoy bound for samar in matnog sorsogon killing two 104 president benigno aquino iii considered declaring martial law in hopes of restoring order in affected areas 105 106 looting intensified as slow recovery efforts forced residents to seek any means necessary to survive tacloban city administrator tecson john lim stated the looting is not criminality it is self-preservation the chicago tribune reported that some areas were on the brink of anarchy though interior secretary mar roxas denied such claims 53 further complicating efforts to retain order was the lack of officers reporting for work in tacloban only 100 of the city s 1,300 police personnel reported for duty 89 in alangalang just west of tacloban eight people were crushed to death after the walls of a warehouse collapsed during a raid on a government rice stockpile approximately 33,000 bags of rice each weighing 50 kg 110 lb were stolen warehouses were also raided in jaro and palo throughout the city of tacloban itself people began looting from homes as stores had been completely emptied 53 criticism

slow government action in the relief effort in response to the typhoon mounted days after the storm had passed media reports criticized the aquino administration for apparent lack of preparation and coordination among government agencies in the aid operation 107 108 up until november 12 five days after the typhoon struck survivors continued to struggle with basic necessities such as food water and shelter while remote towns in leyte and samar were yet to be reached by aid 109 the philippine government responded by saying that they have dealt with the tragedy quite well but the response had been slow due to the breakdown of the local governance in affected areas where officials and employees who were usually the first to respond in these events were victims of the typhoon themselves 110 cabinet secretary jose rene almendras said that the national government had to take over despite logistical challenges and assured it is working toward providing aid the quickest way possible to the survivors 111 the national government was also criticized for putting the responsibility of handling the dead to the bureau of fire instead to the department of health dr racquel fortun one of the forensic experts to go to the area three days after the typhoon insisted that handling of the bodies is a health matter and therefore a responsibility of doh 112 one of the biggest controversies of typhoon haiyan is probably the number of the victims or the body count according to the philippine government sources the number of those killed during the typhoon ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 individuals while some sources claim that the body count reaches up to 15,000 113 114 115 humanitarian crisis and population displacement edit the philippines faced a humanitarian crisis days after the typhoon hit much of the visayas with 1.9 million homeless and more than 6,000,000 displaced 116 in tacloban alone ninety percent of the structures are either destroyed or damaged while other cities such as ormoc are reporting similar damage 117 the united nations fear that the possibility of the spread of disease is high due to the lack of food water shelter and medication casualties have

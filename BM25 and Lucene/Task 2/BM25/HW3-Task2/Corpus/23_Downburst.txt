meteorology severe weather weather forecasting weather portal v t e downburst seen from the armor doppler weather radar in huntsville alabama in 2012 note the winds in green going towards the radar and the winds in red going away from the radar a downburst is a strong ground-level wind system that emanates from a point source above and blows radially that is in a straight line in all directions from the point of contact at ground level often producing damaging winds it may be confused with a tornado where high-velocity winds circle a central area and air moves inward and upward by contrast in a downburst winds are directed downward and then outward from the surface landing point downbursts are created by an area of significantly rain-cooled air that after reaching ground level spreads out in all directions producing strong winds dry downbursts are associated with thunderstorms with very little rain while wet downbursts are created by thunderstorms with high amounts of rainfall microbursts and macrobursts are downbursts at very small and larger scales respectively another variety the heat burst is created by vertical currents on the backside of old outflow boundaries and squall lines where rainfall is lacking heat bursts generate significantly higher temperatures due to the lack of rain-cooled air in their formation downbursts create vertical wind shear or microbursts which is dangerous to aviation definition edit the curl phase soon after an intense microburst hit the surface downburst damages in a straight line source noaa a downburst is created by a column of sinking air that after hitting ground level spreads out in all directions and is capable of producing damaging straight-line winds of over 240 km h 150 mph often producing damage similar to but distinguishable from that caused by tornadoes this is because the physical properties of a downburst are completely different from those of a tornado downburst damage will radiate from a central point as the descending column spreads out when hitting the surface whereas tornado damage tends towards convergent damage consistent with rotating winds to differentiate between tornado damage and damage from a downburst the term straight-line winds is applied to damage from microbursts downbursts are particularly strong downdrafts from thunderstorms downbursts in air that is precipitation free or contains virga are known as dry downbursts 1 those accompanied with precipitation are known as wet downbursts most downbursts are less than 4 km 2.5 mi in extent these are called microbursts 2 downbursts larger than 4 km 2.5 mi in extent are sometimes called macrobursts 2 downbursts can occur over large areas in the extreme case a derecho can cover a huge area more than 320 km 200 mi wide and over 1,600 km 1,000 mi long lasting up to 12 hours or more and is associated with some of the most intense straight-line winds 3 but the generative process is somewhat different from that of most downbursts straight-line winds edit see also derecho straight-line winds also known as thundergusts and hurricanes of the prairie are very strong winds that can produce damage demonstrating a lack of the rotational damage pattern associated with tornadoes 4 straight-line winds are common with the gust front of a thunderstorm or originate with a downburst from a thunderstorm these events can cause considerable damage even in the absence of a tornado the winds can gust to 210 km h 130 mph 5 and winds of 93 km h 58 mph or more can last for more than twenty minutes 6 in the united states such straight-line wind events are most common during the spring when instability is highest and weather fronts routinely cross the country citation needed straight-line wind events in the form of derechos can take place throughout the eastern half of the u.s 7 straight-line winds may be damaging to marine interests small ships cutters and sailboats are at risk from this meteorological phenomenon citation needed formation edit the formation of a downburst starts with hail or large raindrops falling through drier air hailstones melt and raindrops evaporate pulling latent heat from surrounding air and cooling it considerably cooler air has a higher density than the warmer air around it so it sinks to the ground as the cold air hits the ground it spreads out and a mesoscale front can be observed as a gust front areas under and immediately adjacent to the downburst are the areas which receive the highest winds and rainfall if any is present also because the rain-cooled air is descending from the middle troposphere a significant drop in temperatures is noticed due to interaction with the ground the downburst quickly loses strength as it fans out and forms the distinctive curl shape that is commonly seen at the periphery of the microburst see image downbursts usually last only a few minutes and then dissipate except in the case of squall lines and derecho events however despite their short lifespan microbursts are a serious hazard to aviation and property and can result in substantial damage to the area heat bursts edit main article heat burst a special and much rarer kind of downburst is a heat burst which results from precipitation-evaporated air compressionally heating as it descends from very high altitude usually on the backside of a dying squall line or outflow boundary 8 heat bursts are chiefly a nocturnal occurrence can produce winds over 160 km h 100 mph are characterized by exceptionally dry air and can suddenly raise the surface temperature to 38 °c 100 °f or more sometimes persisting for several hours danger to aviation edit further information microburst § danger to aircraft downbursts particularly microbursts are exceedingly dangerous to aircraft which are taking off or landing due to the strong vertical wind shear caused by these events a number of fatal crashes have been attributed to downbursts 9

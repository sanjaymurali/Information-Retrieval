monetary fund reports that as difficult enough as the present fiscal situation is it is unfortunately quite easy to envisage circumstances that would make it even more so furthermore shortfalls in donor financing and tax revenues or events such as a further rise in global oil prices pose a grave risk 51 jamaica edit by two days after ivan s passage usaid’s hurricane recovery program distributed

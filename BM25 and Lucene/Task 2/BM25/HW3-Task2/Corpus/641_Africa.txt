etymology statue representing africa at palazzo ferreria in valletta malta afri was a latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of africa which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the mediterranean ancient libya 9 10 this name seems to have originally referred to a native libyan tribe see terence for discussion the name is usually connected with hebrew or phoenician ʿafar dust but a 1981 hypothesis 11 has asserted that it stems from the berber ifri plural ifran cave in reference to cave dwellers 12 the same word 12 may be found in the name of the banu ifran from algeria and tripolitania a berber tribe originally from yafran also known as ifrane in northwestern libya 13 under roman rule carthage became the capital of the province of africa proconsularis which also included the coastal part of modern libya 14 the latin suffix ica can sometimes be used to denote a land e.g. in celtica from celtae as used by julius caesar the later muslim kingdom of ifriqiya located in modern-day tunisia also preserved a form of the name according to the romans africa lay to the west of egypt while asia was used to refer to anatolia and lands to the east a definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer ptolemy 85–165 ad indicating alexandria along the prime meridian and making the isthmus of suez and the red sea the boundary between asia and africa as europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent the idea of africa expanded with their knowledge other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name africa the 1st-century jewish historian flavius josephus ant 1.15 asserted that it was named for epher grandson of abraham according to gen 25 4 whose descendants he claimed had invaded libya isidore of seville in etymologiae xiv.5.2 suggests africa comes from the latin aprica meaning sunny massey in 1881 stated that africa is derived from the egyptian af-rui-ka meaning to turn toward the opening of the ka the ka is the energetic double of every person and the opening of the ka refers to a womb or birthplace africa would be for the egyptians the birthplace 15 michèle fruyt proposed 16 linking the

africa is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on earth with the human species originating from the continent 18 19 during the mid-20th century anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago bp before present fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man such as australopithecus afarensis radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0 million years bp 20 paranthropus boisei c 2.3–1.4 million years bp 21 and homo ergaster c 1.9 million–600,000 years bp have been discovered 2 after the evolution of homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years bp in africa the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers 22 23 24 these first modern humans left africa and populated the rest of the globe during the out of africa ii migration dated to approximately 50,000 years bp exiting the continent either across bab-el-mandeb over the red sea 25 26 the strait of gibraltar in morocco 27 or the isthmus of suez in egypt 28 other migrations of modern humans within the african continent have been dated to that time with evidence of early human settlement found in southern africa southeast africa north africa and the sahara 29 the size of the sahara has historically been extremely variable with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions 30 at the end of the ice ages estimated to have been around 10,500 bc the sahara had again become a green fertile valley and its african populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub-saharan africa with rock art paintings depicting a fertile sahara and large populations discovered in tassili n ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia 31 however the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 bc the sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile around 3500 bc due to a tilt in the earth s orbit the sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification 32 the population trekked out of the sahara region towards the nile valley below the second cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements a major climatic recession occurred lessening the heavy and persistent rains in central and eastern africa since this time dry conditions have prevailed in eastern africa and increasingly during the last 200 years in ethiopia the domestication of cattle in africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures it is speculated that by 6000 bc cattle were domesticated in north africa 33 in the sahara-nile complex people domesticated many animals including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from algeria to nubia around 4000 bc the saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace 34 this climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification this in turn decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of west africa 34 by the first millennium bc ironworking had been introduced in northern africa and quickly spread across the sahara into the northern parts of sub-saharan africa 35 and by 500 bc metalworking began to become commonplace in west africa ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 bc in many areas of east and west africa although other regions didn t begin ironworking until the early centuries ad

but was succeeded by the mali empire which consolidated much of western sudan in the thirteenth century kanem accepted islam in the eleventh century in the forested regions of the west african coast independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the muslim north the kingdom of nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first it is also one of the oldest kingdoms in

dahomey was one of the non-yoruba domains under oyo control the almoravids were a berber dynasty from the sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern africa and the iberian peninsula during the eleventh century 51 the banu hilal and banu ma qil were a collection of arab bedouin tribes from the arabian peninsula who migrated westwards via egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries their migration resulted in the fusion of the arabs and berbers where the locals were arabized 52 and arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture under the unifying framework of

europeans were captured by barbary pirates and sold as slaves in north africa between the 16th and 19th centuries 60 in west africa the decline of the atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities the gradual decline of slave-trading prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the new world increasing anti-slavery legislation in europe and america and the british royal navy s increasing presence off the west african coast obliged african states to adopt new economies between 1808 and 1860 the british west africa squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 africans who were aboard 61 slave being inspected from captain canot or twenty years of an african slaver action was also taken against african leaders who refused to

european imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent creating many colonial territories and leaving only two fully independent states ethiopia known to europeans as abyssinia and liberia egypt and sudan were never formally incorporated into any european colonial empire however after the british occupation of 1882 egypt was effectively under british administration until 1922 berlin conference the berlin conference held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of african ethnic groups it was convened by king leopold ii of belgium and attended by the european powers that laid claim to african territories it sought to end the european powers scramble for africa by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence they set up the political divisions of the continent by spheres of interest that exist in africa today independence struggles imperial rule by europeans would continue until after the conclusion of world war ii when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence independence movements in africa gained momentum following world war ii which left the major european powers weakened in 1951 libya a former italian colony gained independence in 1956 tunisia and morocco won their independence from france 64 ghana followed suit the next year march 1957 65 becoming the first

declared independence from the united kingdom in 1965 under the white minority government of ian smith but was not internationally recognized as an independent state as zimbabwe until 1980 when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war although south africa was one of the first african countries to gain independence the state remained under the control of the country s white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994 post-colonial africa mobutu sese seko zaire s longtime dictator embezzled over 5 billion from his country today africa contains 54 sovereign countries most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of european colonialism since colonialism african states have frequently been hampered by instability corruption violence and authoritarianism the vast majority of african states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule however few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis and many have instead cycled through a series of coups producing military dictatorships great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups and graft under these leaders for political gain many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts some of which had been exacerbated or even created by colonial rule in many countries the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order and it ruled many nations in africa during the 1970s and early 1980s during the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations border and territorial disputes were also common with the european-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts south african paratroops on a raid in angola during the south african border war cold war conflicts between the united states and the soviet union as well as the policies of the international monetary fund citation needed also played a role in instability when a country became independent for the first time it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers many countries in northern africa received soviet military aid while others in central and southern africa were supported by the united states france or both the 1970s saw an escalation of cold war intrigues as newly independent angola and mozambique aligned themselves with the soviet union and the west and south africa sought to contain soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or

famine in ethiopia when hundreds of thousands of people starved some claimed that marxist economic policies made the situation worse 66 67 68 the most devastating military conflict in modern independent africa has been the second congo war this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people 69 since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster another notable tragic event is the 1994 rwandan genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered aids in post-colonial africa has also been a prevalent issue in the 21st century however the number of armed conflicts in africa has steadily declined for instance the civil war in angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years this has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms the improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many african nations mainly from china 70 which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline several african economies are among the world s fastest growing as of 2016 a significant part of this growth which is sometimes referred to as africa rising can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone 71 geography main article geography of africa satellite photo of africa the sahara desert in the north can be clearly seen a composite satellite image of africa

intensity of earthquakes precisely the agency also utilize about 2,900 more seismographs 11 owned by the national research institute for earth science and disaster prevention nied and local governments a 24-hour office has been housed within the jma headquarters in tokyo for monitoring and tracking seismic events in the vicinity of japan to collect and process their data which issues observed earthquake s information on its hypocenter magnitude seismic intensity and possibility of tsunami occurrence after quakes quickly to the public through the earthquake phenomena observation system epos 13 the earthquake early warning eew system began to work fully for the general public on october 1 2007 the agency is one of the representatives of the national coordinating committee for

direct 1 damage 1.4 billion 1969 usd areas affected cuba yucatan peninsula alabama mississippi louisiana southern united states midwestern united states eastern seaboard part of the 1969 atlantic hurricane season hurricane camille was the second-most intense tropical cyclone to strike the united states on record the most intense storm of the 1969 atlantic hurricane season camille formed as a tropical depression on august 14 south of cuba from a long-tracked tropical wave located in a favorable environment for strengthening the storm quickly intensified into a category 2 hurricane before striking the western part of the nation on august 15 emerging into the gulf of mexico camille underwent another period of rapid intensification and became a category 5 hurricane the next day as it moved northward towards the louisiana–mississippi region despite weakening slightly on august 17 the hurricane quickly re-intensified back to a category 5 before it made landfall in waveland mississippi early on august 18 with a pressure of 900 mbar 26.58 inhg this was the second-lowest pressure recorded for a u.s landfall only the 1935 labor day hurricane had a lower pressure at landfall as camille pushed inland it quickly weakened and was a tropical depression by the time it was over the ohio valley once it emerged offshore it was able to restrengthen to a strong tropical storm before it became extratropical being absorbed by a cold front over the north atlantic on august 22 camille caused tremendous damage in its wake and also produced a peak official storm surge of 24 feet 7.3 m the hurricane flattened nearly everything along the coast of the u.s state of mississippi and caused additional flooding and deaths inland while crossing the appalachian mountains of virginia in total camille killed 259 people and caused 1.42 billion 1969 usd equivalent to 9.27 billion 2016 usd 2 in damages to date a complete understanding of the reasons for the system s power extremely rapid intensification over open water and strength at landfall has not been achieved meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the origins of hurricane camille were from a tropical wave off the western coast of africa on august 5 1969 it tracked quickly westward along the 15th parallel north 3 a tropical disturbance became clearly identifiable on satellite imagery on august 9 by that time the thunderstorm activity concentrated into a circular area of convection the next day it moved through the lesser antilles although there was no evidence of a closed circulation on august 13 the wave passed near or over the southern coast of jamaica as its convection spread northeastward through the bahamas subsequently it began a slower motion to the northwest it is believed that a tropical depression formed shortly thereafter early on august 14 and it became a tropical storm a few hours later on the morning of august 14 the hurricane hunters flew to investigate for a closed circulation near the bahamas as well as near the cayman islands 4 the crew observed a developing center in the western caribbean and winds had reached tropical storm status by then the storm had strengthened into a strong tropical storm with winds of 60 mph 95 km h about 50 miles 80 km west-northwest of grand cayman 4 5 upon first being classified as a tropical storm camille was located in an area favorable for further strengthening although initially it slowly intensified it was located within an area of very light wind shear and an overall warm environment additionally the storm developed strong low-level inflow from the deep southern caribbean which continuously brought moisture into the storm 4 throughout its duration it was a small tropical cyclone although with a radius of gale-force winds spreading 100 miles 160 km to the north the storm s thunderstorm area quickly spread over cuba as the storm approached the western coast of cuba it began rapid deepening reaching hurricane status and less than 12 hours later attained winds of 110 mph 175 km h prior to landfall its eye was tracked by radar from havana it is estimated the hurricane moved ashore between cape san antonio and guane late on august 15 as a strong category 2 hurricane camille was a small hurricane as it crossed western cuba and its winds decreased slightly to 105 mph 165 km h over land before it emerged into the gulf of mexico 5 this new orleans radar image of hurricane camille was taken less than 50 miles from its center on august 17 1969 at 10 p.m cst initially hurricane camille was forecast to turn northeastward toward the florida panhandle instead it continued northwestward and rapidly intensified once again almost immediately after leaving cuba its eye contracted to a diameter of less than 8 miles 13 km and strong rainbands developed around the entire hurricane due to the small eye hurricane hunters at first had difficulties in obtaining the strength however a flight late on august 16 found a strong category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale and recorded a very low pressure of 908 mbar hpa 26.82 inhg with winds estimated at 175 mph 280 km h 4 at the time it was not expected to intensify further 5 however a subsequent hurricane hunters flight early on 17 august recorded a pressure of 905 mbar hpa 26.73 inhg at the time the lowest pressure recorded by reconnaissance aircraft that made camille the most intense hurricane since the 1935 labor day hurricane currently it is the sixth most intense atlantic hurricane as ranked by lowest pressure at the same time maximum wind speeds in the hurricane peaked at 175 mph 280 km h by 00 utc on august 17 6 7 as it continued toward the gulf coast of the united states camille maintained its small eye and forecasters continued to anticipate a turn toward florida 5 late on august 17 camille briefly weakened to a category 4 storm due to an eyewall replacement cycle a reconnaissance flight was forced to end its mission early due to a damaged engine 4 before they left the storm the crew recorded a pressure of 919 mbar hpa 27.14 inhg and estimated surface winds at 155 mph 250 km h while camille was located about 100 miles 160 km southeast of the mississippi river delta 5 there were no subsequent hurricane hunter flights but surface observations recorded later suggested that camille quickly re-strengthened and regained category 5 intensity after passing very near southeastern louisiana hurricane camille made landfall early on august 18 in waveland mississippi 6 maximum wind speeds near the coastline were estimated to have been about 175 mph 280 km h with a pressure of 900 mbar hpa 26.58 inhg 4 the hurricane weakened as it progressed inland and within 14 hours of moving ashore camille weakened to tropical storm status about 12 hours later it weakened to tropical depression status by which time it began a turn to the north and northeast on august 20 tropical depression camille turned eastward through kentucky dropping heavy rainfall in west virginia and virginia later that day it emerged into the atlantic ocean east of norfolk and by that afternoon as it was emerging offshore it regained tropical storm status camille accelerated east-northeastward attaining peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h as it interacted with larger hurricane debbie to its southeast although the poor sampling of the region means that it is possible that the storm may have regained hurricane intensity in a location where measurements of wind speed were not taken 4 subsequently camille began to interact with a cold front causing it to gradually change into an extratropical cyclone as it entrained cooler air on august 22 camille was absorbed by the cold front to the south of atlantic canada 4 5 preparations edit national hurricane center track forecasts for camille from western cuba onward the system s actual track is marked by the line farthest to the west shortly after camille formed the national hurricane center advised residents on the isle of pines and in western cuba to prepare for gale-force winds heavy rains and rising tides the agency also recommended small boats to remain in harbor 5 the threat of the storm prompted officials to evacuate thousands along the western coast of cuba and on the isle of pines on the island 10,000 cattle and 6,000 turkeys were moved to safer areas 8 as camille impacted cuba small craft were advised not to venture out too far from the coasts of florida 9 on 15 august the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch for a 110 miles 180 km stretch of land in florida between apalachicola and fort walton beach the next day as these hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning thousands of people boarded up their homes and evacuated inland during the afternoon of 16 august the weather bureau ordered that a hurricane watch should be placed in force for the coastline from biloxi to st marks florida later that day the hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning for the northwestern florida coast from fort walton to st marks citation needed by saturday morning a hurricane watch was issued for the coast from biloxi eastward civil defense organizations in coastal counties went on alert keesler air force base and the naval construction battalion center prepared for the storm by 5 p.m on sunday a hurricane warning was issued for the coast this activated the national guard units many refused to believe the reports concerning camille s intensity that afternoon many people living at elevations of 20 feet 6.1 m above sea level refused to believe they were going to be submerged the mayor of gulfport ordered the release of prisoners from the city jail as winds increased at 9 p.m on sunday evening but none would leave 10 impact edit most severe landfalling atlantic hurricanes in the united states based on size and intensity for

christian its point of landfall reported from 7 to 10 inches 180 to 250 mm 12 the area of total destruction in harrison county mississippi was 68 square miles 180 km2 13 the total estimated cost of damage was 1.42 billion 1969 usd 9.27 billion 2017 usd 14 this made camille the second-most expensive hurricane in the united states up to that point behind hurricane betsy 15 the storm directly killed 143 people along alabama mississippi and louisiana an additional 153 people perished as a result of catastrophic flooding in nelson county virginia and other areas nearby in all 8,931 people were injured 5,662 homes were destroyed and 13,915 homes experienced major damage with many of the fatalities being coastal residents who had refused to evacuate caribbean and offshore gulf of mexico edit as a developing tropical storm camille brought rain showers to grand cayman although there were no reports of damage 5 stations in cuba on the outer fringes of the storm reported winds of 50 mph 80 km h east of where it moved ashore the city of guane recorded winds of 92 mph 148 km h although no wind reports were taken in the landfall location the hurricane produced up to 10 inches 250 mm near guane as well as on the isle of pines 5 on the isle of pines the storm inflicted damage to about 100 houses 8 throughout pinar del río province camille caused heavy damage 16 primarily from river flooding 17 about 20,000 people were left homeless in the province strong winds downed trees and power lines which caused power outages eastward through the capital city of havana initially the government reported no casualties from the storm 16 subsequent research indicated the hurricane killed five people in the country during its passage and damage was estimated at 5 million 1969 usd 18 in the days after the storm struck cuba the government deployed medical teams to affected regions to provide typhoid vaccine shots officials noted the potential for the spread of disease due to flooding from camille as well as previously wet conditions 8 in the open gulf of mexico the hurricane produced wave heights of at least 70 feet 21 m as measured by shell oil company along the ocean floor the storm created mudslides which lowered the ocean floor its combination with strong waves and winds destroyed three oil platforms including one that at the time was the deepest oil well property damages to the offshore oil industry were initially estimated at 100 million 1969 usd 19 louisiana edit the eastbound lanes of heavily traveled united states u.s highway 90 suffered broken pavement during hurricane camille which halted traffic the pressure fell to 27.80 inches of mercury 941 hpa at garden island winds gusted to 125 miles per hour 201 km h at slidell as their pressure sank to 28.75 inches of mercury 974 hpa on 19 august almost total destruction was seen from venice to buras ostrica lock measured a storm surge of 16 feet 4.9 m water overwashed u.s highway 90 to a depth of 10 feet 3.0 m 20 the highest rainfall report from the state was 5.23 inches 133 mm from slidell 21 camille caused about 322 million 1969 dollars of damage in louisiana 4 fortunately the storm turned just in time to avoid a direct hit to the city of new orleans which was devastated just four years prior by hurricane betsy the worst effects in new orleans proper were flooding from some levees particularly in the lowest lying areas including the lower ninth ward which suffered the most severe flooding during betsy mississippi edit ships beached in gulfport mississippi in mississippi camille was significantly worse than hurricane betsy and a september 1947 hurricane electricity went out during camille s approach to the mississippi coastline united states highway 90 flooded as a large storm surge overtopped seawalls leaving a barge along the highway in gulfport fires consumed coastal communities with the exceptions of bay st louis and waveland camille destroyed the antebellum trinity episcopal church in pass christian taking 15 lives the dixie white house where president woodrow wilson and his family once stayed was badly damaged in biloxi mississippi the storm surge reached the second floor of the structure 10 the highest rainfall total recorded was 10.06 inches 256 mm at the mississippi test facility 21 mississippi received the worst of the damage upon making landfall camille produced a 24 foot 7.3 m storm surge along mississippi s entire shore and for some three to four blocks inland the destruction was nearly complete the worst hit areas were clermont harbor lakeshore waveland bay st louis pass christian long beach and the beach front of gulfport mississippi city and biloxi one of frank lloyd wright s waterfront houses for w l fuller in pass christian was completely destroyed 22 more than 11 inches 280 mm of rain occurred in hancock county and most low-lying areas were flooded with up to 15 feet 4.6 m of water u.s highway 90 which is close to the shore was broken up in many areas and sand and debris blocked much of it totals say that 3,800 homes and businesses were completely destroyed as camille came ashore it passed over ship island off the coast of mississippi camille s strong storm surge and torrential rains literally split the island in two the body of water between west ship island and east ship island is now called camille s cut camille had significant ecological effects in the gulf coast region a barrier island chain off the coast of mississippi and 70 of dauphin island were completely inundated by the storm s surge 23 camille caused about 950 million 1969 dollars of damage in mississippi 4 hurricane party edit richelieu apartments before camille richelieu apartments after camille one persistent account about camille states that 23 people held a hurricane party on the third floor of the richelieu manor apartments in pass christian mississippi in the path of the eyewall as it made landfall the high storm surge flooded and destroyed the building killing all but one person who the survivor is how many party guests there were and just how far the sole survivor was swept by the storm varies with the retelling an abc made-for-tv movie called hurricane starring frank sutton of gomer pyle usmc larry hagman will geer martin milner and michael learned was loosely based on the supposed hurricane party however the site and names were changed to fictitious ones for the movie as was the name of the hurricane the television show quantum leap carried an episode regarding the parties of hurricane camille and the actual hurricane itself twenty-three people are known to have stayed in the richelieu apartments during the hurricane eight of whom died the tale of the lone survivor and the party appears to have originated with survivor mary ann gerlach 10 survivor ben duckworth has expressed irritation at the story there was no hurricane party duckworth reiterated in 2001 we were exhausted from boarding up windows and helping the police move cars we were too tired to party i can’t tell you why that story persists or why people didn t put two and two together i guess the hurricane party makes a good story 24 the site of the richelieu apartments the corner of henderson avenue and us 90 in pass christian later became a shopping center coincidentally it was destroyed by hurricane katrina alabama and florida edit alabama also experienced damage along u.s highway 90 26,000 homes and over 1,000 businesses were wiped out completely across the state of alabama camille s large circulation also resulted in a 3-to-5-foot 0.91 to 1.52 m storm surge in apalachicola florida the highest rainfall report received within alabama was 6.52 inches 166 mm two miles northeast of fairhope 21 camille caused about 8 million 1969 dollars of damage in alabama 4 places farther east across the western florida panhandle saw lesser rains as 4.16 inches 106 mm was measured at pensacola naval air station 25 ohio valley and west virginia edit camille storm total rainfall camille caused moderate rainfall in tennessee and kentucky of between 3 and 5 inches 130 mm 26 helping to relieve a drought in the area yet in west virginia there was flash flooding which destroyed 36 houses and 12 trailers a total of three quarters of a million dollars in damage 27 virginia edit because the hurricane was expected to quickly dissipate over land few were prepared for the flash flooding 28 arriving in virginia on the evening of august 19 camille was no longer a hurricane but it carried high amounts of moisture and contained sufficient strength and low pressure to pull in additional moisture a widespread area of western and central virginia received over 8 inches 200 mm of rain from camille s remains leading to significant flooding across the state a total of 153 people lost their lives from blunt trauma sustained during mountain slides related to the flash flooding not drowning 29 more than 123 of these deaths including 21 members of one family the huffmans were in nelson county debris avalanches occurred on hillsides with a slope greater than 35 percent 29 in nelson county the number of deaths amounted to over one percent of the county s population 30 the worst of the damage was reported in massies mill woods mill roseland bryant tyro montebello lovingston norwood rockfish and along the davis and muddy creeks 29 the james and tye rivers crested well above flood stage in many areas including a record high of 41.3 feet 12.6 m at columbia virginia hurricane camille caused more than 140 million of damage 1969 dollars in virginia 4 5 camille was considered one of the worst natural disasters in central virginia s recorded history 29 flooding damage at howardsville virginia the bridge formerly carried virginia route 626 over the rockfish river the storm dropped torrential rainfall of 12 to 20 inches 300 to 510 mm with a maximum of 27 inches 690 mm 26 most of the rainfall occurred in virginia during a 3-5 hour period on 19–20 august five 5 plus inches of rain fell near the north fork of the tye river in only half an hour with the grounds already saturated from previous rains 28 many rivers flooded across the state with the worst being the james river in richmond with a peak crest of 28.6 feet 8.7 m many rivers in virginia and west virginia set records for peak flood stages causing numerous mudslides along mountainsides in the mountain slopes between charlottesville and lynchburg more than 26 inches 660 mm of rain fell in 12 hours but the worst was in nelson county where 27 inches 690 mm fell there rainfall was so heavy that reports were received of birds drowning in trees cows floating down the hatt creek and of survivors having to cup hands around their mouth and nose in order to breathe through the deluge though the official rainfall was recorded as 27 inches unofficial estimates are much greater some estimate that more than 40 inches of rain fell at davis creek most gauges were washed away however it was reported that an empty 55 gallon drum that was not even in the center of the heaviest rainfall had 31 inches of water in it after camille passed 31 so much rain fell in such a short time in nelson county that according to the national weather service at the time it was the probable maximum rainfall which meteorologists compute to be theoretically possible 32 the ensuing flash floods and mudslides killed 153 people in nelson county alone 133 bridges washed out while in some places entire communities were under water 27 the major flooding that occurred downstream cut off all communication between richmond and the shenandoah valley waynesboro on the south river saw eight feet of water downtown and buena vista had more than five feet throughout virginia camille destroyed 313 houses 71 trailers and 430 farm buildings 3,765 families were affected by the hurricane in the area and total damage in the state amounted to 140.8 million

was the labor day hurricane of 1935 6 36 a reconnaissance flight indicated a pressure of 901 millibars 26.6 inhg 37 but this pressure was later corrected in 1969 by researchers to 919 mb 27.14 inhg 6 the wind speed of camille can only be approximated as no meteorological equipment survived the extreme conditions at landfall but camille is estimated to have had sustained winds of 190 mph 305 km h at landfall with gusts exceeding 230 mph 370 km h 6 37 although a reanalysis in april 2014 concluded that camille had maximum winds of 175 mph 280 km h rather than the 190 beforehand before hurricane katrina in 2005 camille likely had the highest storm surge measured in the united states at over 24 feet 7.3 m 38 the 24-foot 7.3 m storm surge quoted by the army corps of engineers was based on high-water marks inside surviving buildings of which there were but three prior to the collapse of the richelieu apartments ben duckworth shone a flashlight down a stairwell and found the water within one step of the third-story floor this establishes a surge height of 28 feet 8.5 m at that spot at that time about 15 minutes later the building collapsed and the evidence vanished with it in addition camille forced the mississippi river to flow backwards for a river-distance of 125 miles from its mouth to a point north of new orleans the river further backed up for an additional 120 miles 190 km to a point north of baton rouge 39 in 1969 the naming conventions for hurricanes were not strictly controlled as they are today there were only three requirements the name had to be female male names were not used at that time the names had to remain in alphabetical order and the name could not have been retired aftermath edit deaths and damage by region region deaths damage 1969 usd cuba 5

august parts of mississippi and louisiana were declared major disaster areas and became eligible for federal disaster relief funds 40 president richard m nixon ordered 1450 regular troops and 800 united states army engineers into the area to bring tons of food vehicles and aircraft 10 large organizations contributing to the relief effort included the federal power commission which helped fully return power to affected areas by 25 november 1969 the coast guard then under the department of transportation air force army army corps of engineers navy seabees and marine corps all helped with evacuations search and rescue clearing debris and distribution of food the department of defense contributed 34 million 1969 usd 180 million 2005 usd 14 and 16,500 military troops overall to the recovery the department of health provided 4 million dollars towards medicine vaccines and other health related needs 40 on monday the air national guard and those at keesler air force base airlifted

30 million 1969 usd 159 million 2005 usd 14 towards planned and coordinated redevelopment of affected areas noaa weather radio was expanded to coastal locations during the 1970s in the wake of camille based upon recommendations made by the department of commerce in september 1969 41 the devastation of camille inspired the implementation of the saffir-simpson hurricane scale after the storm many gulf coast residents commented that hurricane warnings were not clear enough in conveying the expected intensity of the coming storm the saffir-simpson scale offered a much more concise statement of storm intensity than barometric pressure and wind-speed measurements and veterans of previous hurricanes could analogize the power of the approaching storm to those they had experienced 42 in a 1999 report on hurricane camille sponsored by the noaa coastal services center the authors concluded with camille the preparations for the event and the response were based on processes put in place long before the storm made landfall coordination between government agencies as well as with state and local officials was enhanced because of preexisting plans 40 one small compensation was that recovery from flood damage in nelson county virginia led to the discovery of the ginger gold apple in the orchards of clyde harvey 43 retirement edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names due to the major destruction and death in much of the southern united states the name camille was retired after the 1969 season 44 and will never again be used for an atlantic or gulf hurricane or tropical storm the name cindy was scheduled to replace the name in 1973 45 although a new ten-year list of names was created for the 1972-1980 atlantic hurricane seasons 46 comparisons to hurricane katrina edit see also hurricane katrina comparison of hurricanes camille left and katrina on satellite imagery although hurricane camille and hurricane katrina took different paths they both reached the same section of the coast of mississippi with similar destructive effects camille intensified more rapidly than katrina and unlike katrina camille re-intensified a second time and maintained status as a category 5 hurricane until landfall both hurricanes shared the common aspect of undergoing periods of rapid intensification 47 the size of camille s radius of maximum wind was less than one-third that of katrina more similar to the intense but small hurricane andrew also unlike katrina camille caused little damage in new orleans louisiana though camille itself just barely missed the city 48 the area of hurricane-force winds within camille was just over two-thirds the size of hurricane katrina both storms were moving at a similar forward motion at the time of landfall although camille s wind speed at landfall was higher katrina s storm surge exceeded camille s storm surge at all known locations due to its greater size 49 both hurricanes names were retired due to the time period between the two hurricanes along with the approximate same landfall locations sizes and intensities of the two storms katrina had been nicknamed camille s deadly daughter in culture edit films edit a lady

crimes of the heart 1979 takes place in hazlehurst mississippi and is set five years after hurricane camille while the hurricane is rarely mentioned in the script it is cited as the cause of doc porter s limp and the reason meg magrath has been shunned by most of the town the play was originally produced by the actors theatre of louisville inc in february 1979 and received its new york premiere at the manhattan theatre club in 1980 in 2008 lynchburg virginia-based endstation theatre company then based in amherst virginia premiered an original play the bluest water a hurricane camille story by playwright jason chimonides as part of its inaugural blue ridge summer theatre festival on the campus of sweet briar college 54 while the play was partly historical fiction featuring

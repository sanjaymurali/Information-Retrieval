third hurricane of the very active 1933 atlantic hurricane season it formed in the eastern atlantic where it moved west-northwestward and eventually became a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale nb 1 a strong ridge over new england allowed a continued northwest course bringing the storm south of bermuda and later toward the middle coast of the eastern united states advance warning allowed hundreds of people to evacuate ahead of the hurricane making landfall it did so in northeastern north carolina on august 23 with winds of about 90 mph 150 km h soon after the eye crossed over norfolk virginia the first time that happened since 1821 the hurricane weakened into a tropical storm over northern virginia shortly before passing near washington d.c. becoming the worst tropical cyclone there since 1896 curving northward the storm moved through pennsylvania and new york before losing tropical characteristics on august 25 now extratropical the former hurricane moved across

boats and destroyed a fishing pier while in new york flooding caused traffic jams in atlantic canada heavy rainfall assisted firefighters in combating wildfires and the associated winds caused isolated power outages meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on august 13 a tropical depression developed near the west coast of africa southeast of cape verde with an associated closed circulation based on observations from a nearby ship it is estimated the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm while moving generally to the west-northwest for several days the storm continued this general trajectory eventually shifting more to the northwest based on interpolation of reports it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on august 16 while halfway between africa and the lesser antilles 4 the weather bureau began tracking the system on august 18 5 later that day a ship reported a pressure of 948 mbar 28.0 inhg suggesting winds of 135 mph 215 km h this made the hurricane a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale another ship report on august 20 indicated a pressure of 940 mbar 28 inhg while reporting hurricane winds suggesting peak winds of 140 mph 230 km h 4 after remaining near peak intensity for three days the hurricane began steadily weakening while curving more to the west-northwest 4 a rare track for the region due to steering from a ridge over new england 6 on august 21 the storm passed about 150 mi 240 km southwest of bermuda at 1000 utc on august 23 the hurricane made landfall along the northern outer banks of north carolina 4 near nags head 1 with a pressure of 963 mbar 28.4 inhg based on the steady weakening coastal observations and a larger than normal size landfall winds were estimated at 90 mph 150 km h a few hours later the hurricane made another landfall on the north carolina mainland after crossing the albemarle sound while the hurricane continued to the northwest the eye briefly moved over norfolk virginia 4 for the first time since the 1821 norfolk and long island hurricane 1 early on august 24 the hurricane weakened into a tropical storm while passing near washington d.c curving to the north the storm crossed pennsylvania and into new york where it weakened further into a tropical depression on august 25 the former hurricane turned to the east near the canada–us border and after interacting with a cold front became extratropical it emerged from maine and briefly re-intensified moving across southern nova scotia with gale force winds on august 28 the circulation dissipated to the south of newfoundland 4 preparations and impact edit track of the 1933 hurricane across virginia and maryland the hurricane

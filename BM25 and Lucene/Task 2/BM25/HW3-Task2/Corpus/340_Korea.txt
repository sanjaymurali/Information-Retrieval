sovereign states north korea officially the democratic people s republic of korea and south korea officially the republic of korea located on the korean peninsula korea is bordered by china to the northwest and russia to the northeast it is separated from japan to the east by the korea strait and the sea of japan east sea korea emerged as a singular political entity in 936ce after centuries of conflict among the three kingdoms of korea which were unified as later silla to the south and balhae to the north later silla divided into three separate states during the later three kingdoms period goryeo which had succeeded goguryeo defeated the two other states and united the korean peninsula around the same time balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to goryeo goryeo also spelled as koryŏ whose name developed into the modern exonym korea was a highly cultured state that created the world s first metal movable type in 1234 4 5 6 7 8 9 however multiple invasions by the mongol yuan dynasty during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting following the yuan dynasty s collapse severe political strife followed and goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by general yi seong-gye who established joseon in 1392 the first 200 years of joseon were marked by relative peace during this period the korean alphabet was created by sejong the great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of confucianism during the later part of the dynasty korea s isolationist policy earned it the western nickname of the hermit kingdom by the late 19th century the country became the object of imperial design by the empire of japan after the first sino-japanese war despite the korean empire s effort to modernize it was annexed by japan in 1910 and ruled by imperial japan until the end of world war ii in august 1945 in 1945 the soviet union and the united states agreed on the surrender of japanese forces in korea in the aftermath of world war ii leaving korea partitioned along the 38th parallel the north was under soviet occupation and the south under u.s occupation these circumstances soon became the basis for the division of korea by the two superpowers exacerbated by their incapability to agree on the terms of korean independence the communist-inspired government in the north received backing from the soviet union in opposition to the pro-western government in the south leading to korea s division into two political entities north korea formally the democratic people s republic of korea and south korea formally the republic of korea tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 with involvement by foreign troops the war ended in a stalemate in 1953 but without a formalized peace treaty this status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula to date each country contends that it is the sole legitimate government of all of korea they refuse to recognize the other as legitimate etymology edit main article names of korea see also korean romanization korea is the modern spelling of corea 고려 a name

and one of the great powers in east asia 20 21 22 23 reaching its zenith in the 5th century when its territories expanded to encompass most of manchuria to the north parts of inner mongolia to the west 24 parts of russia to the east 25 and the seoul region to the south 26 goguryeo experienced a golden age under gwanggaeto the great and his son jangsu 27 28 29 30 who both subdued baekje and silla during their times achieving a brief unification of the three kingdoms of korea and becoming the most dominant power on the korean peninsula 31 32 in addition to contesting for control of the korean peninsula goguryeo had many military conflicts with various chinese dynasties 33 most notably the goguryeo-sui war in which goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men 34 35 36 37 38 in 642 the powerful general yeon gaesomun led a coup and gained complete control over goguryeo in response emperor tang taizong of china led a campaign against goguryeo but was defeated

defenses and was defeated in 662 41 42 however yeon gaesomun died of a natural cause in 666 and goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother

role in transmitting advanced chinese culture to the japanese archipelago baekje was once a great military power on the korean peninsula most notably in the 4th century during the rule of geunchogo when its influence extended across the sea to liaoxi and shandong in china taking advantage of the weakened state of former qin and kyushu in the japanese archipelago 62 however baekje was critically defeated by gwanggaeto the great and declined 63 although later records claim that silla was the oldest of the three kingdoms of korea it is now believed to have been the last kingdom to develop by the 2nd century silla existed as a large state in the southeast occupying and influencing its neighboring city-states in 562 silla annexed the gaya confederacy which was located between baekje and silla the three kingdoms of korea often warred with each other and silla was often dominated by baekje and goguryeo silla was the smallest and weakest of the three but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful korean kingdoms and eventually tang china to its great advantage 64 65 in 660 king muyeol ordered his armies to attack baekje general

1 3 of north korea but later on managed to recover most of the korean peninsula momentarily goryeo advanced to parts of jiandao while conquering the jurchens but returned the territories due to the harsh climate and difficulties in defending them the name goryeo 高麗 is a short form of goguryeo 高句麗 and was first used during the time of king jangsu goryeo regarded itself as the successor of goguryeo hence its name and efforts to recover the former territories of goguryeo 94 95 96 97 wang geon the founder of goryeo was of goguryeo descent 98 and traced his ancestry to a noble goguryeo clan 99 he made kaesong his hometown the capital during this period laws were codified and a civil service system was introduced buddhism flourished and spread throughout the peninsula the development of celadon industries flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries the publication of the tripitaka koreana onto more than 80,000 wooden blocks and the invention of the world s first metal movable type in the 13th century attest to goryeo s cultural achievements 4 5 6 7 8 9 goryeo had to defend frequently against attacks by nomadic empires especially the khitans and the mongols goryeo had a hostile relationship with the khitans because the khitan empire had destroyed balhae also a successor state of goguryeo in 993 the khitans who had established the liao dynasty in 907 invaded goryeo demanding that it make amity with them goryeo sent the diplomat seo hui to negotiate who successfully persuaded the khitans to let goryeo expand to the banks of the amnok river citing that in the past the land belonged to goguryeo the predecessor of goryeo 100 during the goryeo–khitan war the khitan empire invaded korea twice more in 1009 and 1018 but was defeated after defeating the khitan empire which was the most powerful empire of its time 101 102 goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century during which the tripitaka koreana was completed and there were great developments in printing and publishing promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy literature religion and science by 1100 there were 12 universities that produced famous scholars and scientists 103 104 goryeo was invaded by the mongols in seven major campaigns from the 1230s until the 1270s but was never conquered 105 exhausted after decades of fighting goryeo sent its crown prince to the yuan capital to swear allegiance to the mongols kublai khan accepted and married one of his daughters to the korean crown prince 105 and the dynastic line of goryeo continued to survive under the overlordship of the mongol yuan dynasty as a semi-autonomous vassal state and compulsory ally the two nations became intertwined for 80 years as all subsequent korean kings married mongol princesses 105 and the last empress of the yuan dynasty was a korean princess 106 in the 1350s king gongmin was free at last to reform the goryeo government when the yuan dynasty began to crumble gongmin had various problems that needed to be dealt with which included the removal of pro-mongol aristocrats and military officials the question of land holding and quelling the growing animosity between the buddhists and confucian scholars during this tumultuous period goryeo momentarily conquered liaoyang in 1356 repulsed two large invasions by the red turbans in 1359 and 1360 and defeated the final attempt by the yuan to dominate

confucianism as the country s official ideology resulting in much loss of power and wealth by the buddhists the prevailing philosophy of the joseon dynasty was neo-confucianism which was epitomized by the seonbi class scholars who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity joseon was a nominal tributary state of china but exercised full sovereignty 108 109 and maintained the highest position among china s tributary states 110 111 which also included countries such as the ryukyu kingdom vietnam thailand 112 113 114 the philippines burma laos among others 115

1637 and then went on to conquer the destabilized ming dynasty after normalizing relations with the new qing dynasty joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace kings yeongjo and jeongjo led a new renaissance of the joseon dynasty during the 18th century 129 130 in the 19th century the royal in-law families gained control of the government leading to mass corruption and weakening of the

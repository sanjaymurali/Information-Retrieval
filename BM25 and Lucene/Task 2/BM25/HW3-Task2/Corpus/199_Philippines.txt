million additional filipinos lived overseas 21 comprising one of the world s largest diasporas multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands in prehistoric times negritos were some of the archipelago s earliest inhabitants they were followed by successive waves of austronesian peoples 22 exchanges with chinese malay indian and islamic nations occurred then various competing maritime states were established under the rule of datus rajahs sultans or lakans the arrival of ferdinand magellan in homonhon eastern samar in 1521 marked the beginning of hispanic colonization in 1543 spanish explorer ruy lópez de villalobos named the archipelago las islas filipinas in honor of philip ii of spain with the arrival of miguel lópez de legazpi from mexico city in 1565 the first hispanic settlement in the archipelago was established 23 the philippines became part of the spanish empire for more than 300 years this resulted in catholicism becoming the dominant religion during this time manila became the western hub of the trans-pacific trade connecting asia with acapulco in the americas using manila galleons 24 as the 19th century gave way to the 20th there followed in quick succession the philippine revolution which spawned the short-lived first philippine republic followed by the bloody philippine–american war of conquest by us military force 25 aside from the period of japanese occupation the united states retained sovereignty over the islands until after world war ii when the philippines was recognized as an independent nation since then the philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution 26 it is a founding member of the united nations world trade organization association of southeast asian nations the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum and the east asia summit it also hosts the headquarters of the asian development bank 27 the philippines

honor of king philip ii of spain spanish explorer ruy lópez de villalobos during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of leyte and samar felipinas after the then-prince of asturias eventually the name las islas filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago before that became commonplace other names such as islas del poniente islands of the west and magellan s name for the islands san lázaro were also used by the spanish to refer to the islands 30 31 32 33 34 the official name of the philippines has changed several times in the course of its history during the philippine revolution the malolos congress proclaimed the establishment of the república filipina or the philippine republic from the period of the spanish–american war 1898 and the philippine–american war 1899–1902 until the commonwealth period 1935–46 american colonial authorities referred to the country as the philippine islands a translation of the spanish name 25 from the 1898 treaty of paris the name philippines began to appear and it has since become the country s common name since the end of world war ii the official name of the country has been the republic of the philippines 35 history main article history of the philippines prehistory further information prehistory of the philippines the tabon caves are the site of one of the oldest human remains known in the philippines the tabon man the metatarsal of the callao man reliably dated by uranium-series dating to 67,000 years ago is the oldest human remnant found in the archipelago to date 36 this distinction previously belonged to the tabon man of palawan carbon-dated to around 26,500 years ago 37 38 negritos were also among the archipelago s earliest inhabitants but their first settlement in the philippines has not been reliably dated 39 there are several opposing theories regarding the origins of ancient filipinos f landa jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the filipinos evolved locally wilhelm solheim s island origin theory 40 postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the sundaland area around 48,000 to 5000 bc rather than by wide-scale migration the austronesian expansion theory explains that malayo-polynesians coming from taiwan began migrating to the philippines around 4000 bc displacing earlier arrivals 41 the most widely accepted theory based on linguistic and archeological evidence is the out-of-taiwan model which hypothesizes that austronesians from taiwan who were themselves descended from the neolithic civilizations of the yangtze river such as the liangzhu culture 42 began migrating to the philippines around 4000 bc displacing earlier arrivals 41 43 during the neolithic period a jade culture is said to have existed as evidenced by tens of thousands of exquisitely crafted jade artifacts found in the philippines dated to 2000 bc 44 45 the jade is said to have originated nearby in taiwan and is also found in many other areas in insular and mainland southeast asia these artifacts are said to be evidence of long range communication between prehistoric southeast asian societies 46 by 1000 bc the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four kinds of social groups hunter-gatherer tribes warrior societies highland plutocracies and port principalities 47 precolonial epoch further information history of the philippines 900–1521 religion in pre-colonial philippines and cultural achievements of pre-colonial philippines the laguna copperplate inscription c 900 the oldest known historical record found in the philippines discovered at lumban laguna the ifugao igorot people utilized terrace farming in the steep mountainous regions of northern philippines over 2000 years ago pictured are the banaue rice terraces a boxer codex image illustrating the ancient kadatuan or tumao noble class the current demarcation between the prehistory and the early history of the philippines is 21 april 900 which is the equivalent on the proleptic gregorian calendar for the date indicated on the laguna copperplate inscription—the earliest known surviving written record to come from the philippines 48 this date came in the middle of what anthropologists refer to as the philippines emergent phase 1st–14th centuries ce which was characterized by newly emerging socio-cultural patterns the initial development of large coastal settlements greater social stratification and specialization and the beginnings of local and international trade 49 by the 1300s a number of the large coastal settlements had become progressive trading centers and became the focal point of societal changes ushering complex lifeways which characterized what f landa jocano called the barangic phase of early philippine history beginning from the 14th century through the arrival of spanish colonizers and the beginning of the philippines colonial period 49 the discovery of iron at around the 1st century ad created significant social and economic changes which allowed settlements to grow larger and develop new social patterns characterized by social stratification and specialization 49 some of these polities particularly the coastal settlements at or near the mouths of large rivers 50 eventually developed substantial trade contacts with the early trading powers of southeast asia most importantly the indianized kingdoms of malaysia and java the various dynasties of china 50 thailand 51 and later the muslim sultanate of brunei 52 they also traded with vietnam 51 japan 53 and other austronesian islands 54 based on archeological findings trade with china is believed to have begun in the tang dynasty but grew more extensive during the song dynasty 52 by the 2nd millennium ce some but not all philippine polities were known to have sent trade delegations which participated in the tributary system enforced by the chinese imperial court 52 these tributary states nominally acknowledged the sinocentric system which saw china and the imperial court as the cultural center of the world among the early philippine polities this arrangement fulfilled the requirements for trade with china but did not actually translate into political or military control 52 50 regarding the relations of early philippine polities with the various state-level polities of indonesia and malaysia legendary accounts often mention the interaction of early philippine polities with the srivijaya empire but there is not much archeological evidence to definitively support such a relationship 49 considerable evidence exists on the other hand for extensive trade with the majapahit empire 55 the exact scope and mechanisms of indian cultural influences on early philippine polities are still the subject of some debate among southeast asian historiographers 49 56 but the current scholarly consensus is that there was probably little or no direct trade between india and the philippines 49 56 and indian cultural traits such as linguistic terms and religious practices 55 filtered in during the 10th through the early 14th centuries through early philippine polities relations with the hindu majapahit empire 49 the philippine archipelago is thus one of the countries others include afghanistan and southern vietnam just at the outer edge of what is considered the greater indian cultural zone 56 the early polities of the philippine archipelago were typically characterized by a three-tier social structure 49 50 although different cultures had different terms to describe them this three-tier structure invariably consisted of an apex nobility class a class of freemen and a class of dependent debtor-bondsmen called alipin or oripun 49 50 among the members of the nobility class were leaders who held the political office of datu which was responsible for leading autonomous social groups called barangay or dulohan 49 whenever these barangays banded together either to form a larger settlement 49 or a geographically looser alliance group 50 the more senior or respected among them would be recognized as a paramount datu variedly called a lakan sultan rajah or simply a more senior datu 52 49 57 early historic coastal polities the earliest historical record of these kingdoms is the laguna copperplate inscription which indirectly refers to the tagalog settlement of tondo c. before 900–1589 and two to three other settlements believed to be located somewhere near tondo as well as a settlement near mt diwata in mindanao and the temple complex of medang in java 48 although the precise political relationships between these polities is unclear in the text of the inscription the artifact is usually accepted as evidence of intra and inter-regional political linkages as early as 900 ce 48 52 50 by the arrival of the earliest european ethnographers during the 1500s tondo was led by the paramount ruler called a lakan 52 50 it had grown into a major trading hub sharing a monopoly with the rajahnate of maynila over the trade of ming dynasty 58 products throughout the archipelago 52 this trade was significant enough that the yongle emperor appointed a chinese governor named ko ch a-lao to oversee it 59 60 the next historical record referred a location in the philippines is volume 186 of official history of the song dynasty which describes the country of ma-i c. before 971 – after 1339 song dynasty traders visited ma-i annually and their accounts described ma-i s geography trade products and the trade behaviors of its rulers 61 because the descriptions of mai s location in these accounts are not clear there is some dispute about mai s possible location with some scholars believing it was located in bay laguna 62 and others believing it was on the island of mindoro 38 the official history of the song dynasty next refers to the rajahnate of butuan c. before 1001–1756 in northeastern mindanao which is the first polity from the philippine archipelago recorded as having sent a tribute mission to the chinese empire – on march 17 1001 ce butuan attained prominence under the rule of rajah sri bata shaja 54 who was from a buddhist ruling-class governing a hindu nation this state became powerful due to the local goldsmith industry and it also had commercial ties and a diplomatic rivalry with the champa civilization the kedatuan of madja-as c. 1200–1569 was founded following a civil war in collapsing srivijaya wherein loyalists of the malay datus of srivijaya defied the invading chola dynasty and its puppet-rajah called makatunao and set up a guerrilla-state in the islands of the visayas its founding datu puti had purchased land for his new realms from the aboriginal ati hero marikudo 63 verification needed madja-as was founded on panay island named after the destroyed state of pannai allied under srivijaya which was located in sumatra afterwards the people of madja-as often raided the port cities of southern china and warred with the chinese navy 64 the rajahnate of cebu 65 c. 1200–1565 was a neighbor of madja-as in the visayas led by rajamuda sri lumay a monarch with partial tamil descent this state grew wealthy by making use of the inter-island shipping within the archipelago 66 both the rajahnates of butuan and cebu were allied to each other and they also maintained contact and had trade routes with kutai a hindu country 67 in south borneo established by indian traders 68 the earliest legendary date mentioning the rajahnate of maynila c. 1258–1571 on the island of luzon across the pasig river from tondo has to do with the naval victory of the bruneian rajah ahmad over the majapahit rajah avirjirkaya who ruled a prior pre-muslim settlement in the same location 52 chinese records of this period also mention a polity called luzon this is believed to be a reference to maynila since portuguese and spanish accounts from the 1520s explicitly state that luçon and maynila were one and the same 52 although some historians argue that since none of these observers actually visited maynila luçon may simply have referred to all the tagalog and kapampangan polities that rose up on the shores of manila bay 69 either way from the early 1500s to as late as the 1560s this seafaring people was referred to in portuguese malacca as luções and they participated in trading ventures and military campaigns in myanmar malacca and east timor 70 71 72 where they were employed as traders and mercenaries 73 74 75 in northern luzon the wangdom of pangasinan c. 1406–1576 sent emissaries to china in 1406–1411 76 the 1300s saw the arrival and eventual spread of islam in the philippine archipelago in 1380 karim ul makdum and shari ful hashem syed abu bakr an arab trader born in johore arrived in sulu from malacca and established the sultanate of sulu by converting sulu s rajah rajah baguinda ali and marrying his daughter 77 78 at the end of the 15th century shariff mohammed kabungsuwan of johor introduced islam in the island of mindanao and established the sultanate of maguindanao the sultanate form of government extended further into lanao 79 islam then started to spread out of mindanao in the south and went into luzon in the north manila in luzon was islamized during the reign of sultan bolkiah in 1485 to 1521 this was accomplished because the sultanate of brunei subjugated the kingdom of tondo by defeating rajah gambang in battle and thereafter installing the muslim rajah rajah sulaiman i to the throne and by establishing the bruneian puppet-state of the rajahnate of maynila 80 81 82 83 sultan bolkiah also married laila mecana the daughter of sulu sultan amir ul-ombra to expand brunei s influence in both luzon and mindanao 84 the muslims then proceeded to wage wars and conduct slave-raids against the visayans 85 participating in the muslim raids the sultanate of ternate consequently destroyed the kedatuan of dapitan in bohol 86 the rivalries between the datus rajahs sultans and lakans eventually eased spanish colonization furthermore the islands were sparsely populated 87 due to consistent natural disasters 88 and inter-kingdom conflicts therefore colonization was made easy and the small states of the archipelago quickly became incorporated into the spanish empire and were hispanicized and christianized 89 colonial era spanish rule further information history of the philippines 1521–1898 a sketch of a manila galleon used during the manila-acapulco trade in 1521 portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan s expedition arrived in the philippines claimed the islands for spain and was then killed at the battle of mactan 90 colonization began when spanish explorer miguel lópez de legazpi arrived from mexico in 1565 and formed the first hispanic settlements in cebu after relocating to panay island and consolidating a coalition of native visayan allies hispanic soldiers and latin-american recruits the spaniards then invaded islamic manila therein they put down the tondo conspiracy and exiled the conspirators to guam and guerrero 91 under spanish rule they established manila as the capital of the spanish east indies 1571 92 they also defeated the chinese warlord limahong 93 94 to counteract the islamization of the philippines the spanish then conducted the castilian war which was aimed against the sultanate of brunei 95 96 and war was also waged against the sultanate of ternate and tidore in response to ternatean slaving and piracy against spain s allies bohol and butuan 97 the spanish considered their war with the muslims in southeast asia a continuation of the reconquista and part of a larger ibero-islamic world conflict 98 that included a rivalry with the ottoman caliphate which had a center of operations at its nearby vassal the sultanate of aceh 99 consequently fortifications were also set up in taiwan and the maluku islands these were abandoned and the spanish soldiers along with the newly christianized papuan natives of the moluccas withdrew back to the philippines in order to re-concentrate their military forces because of a threatened invasion by the japan-born ming-dynasty loyalist koxinga ruler of the kingdom of tungning 100 however the planned invasion was aborted meanwhile settlers were sent to the pacific islands of palau and the marianas 101 spanish rule eventually contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the fragmented states of the archipelago from 1565 to 1821 the philippines was governed as a territory of the mexico-based viceroyalty of new spain and then was administered directly from madrid after the mexican war of independence the manila galleons the largest wooden ships ever built were constructed in bicol and cavite 102 the manila galleons were accompanied with a large naval escort as it traveled to and from manila and acapulco 103 the galleons sailed once or twice a year between the 16th and 19th centuries 104 the manila galleons brought with them goods 105 settlers 106 and military reinforcements destined for the philippines from latin america 107 trade introduced foodstuffs such as maize tomatoes potatoes chili peppers chocolate and pineapples from mexico and peru within the philippines the marquisate of buglas was established and the rule of it was awarded to sebastian elcano and his crew the survivors of the first circumnavigation of the world as well as his descendants new towns were also created 94 and catholic missionaries converted most of the lowland inhabitants to christianity 108 they also founded schools a university hospitals and churches which were built along the earthquake baroque architectural style 109 to defend their settlements the spaniards constructed and manned a network of military fortresses called presidios across the archipelago 110 the spanish also decreed the introduction of free public schooling in 1863 111 as a result of these policies the philippine population increased exponentially 112 113 the landing of the spanish expedition to sulu by antonio brugada during its rule spain quelled various indigenous revolts there were also several external military challenges from chinese and japanese pirates the dutch the english the portuguese and the muslims of southeast asia those challengers were fought off despite the hostile forces having encircled the philippine archipelago in a crescent formed from japan to indonesia british forces occupied manila from 1762 to 1764 in an extension of the fighting of the seven years war spanish rule was restored following the 1763 treaty of paris 89 114 115 the spanish–moro conflict lasted for several hundred years in the last quarter of the 19th century spain conquered portions of mindanao and the moro muslims in the sulu sultanate formally recognized spanish sovereignty in the 19th century philippine ports opened to world trade and shifts started occurring within philippine society many spaniards born in the philippines criollos 116 and those of mixed ancestry mestizos became wealthy and an influx of latin american immigrants 117 opened up government positions traditionally held by spaniards born in the iberian peninsula peninsulares the ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands criollo dissatisfaction resulted in the 1872 cavite mutiny that was a precursor to the philippine revolution 89 118 119 120 revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 after three priests—mariano gómez josé burgos and jacinto zamora collectively known as gomburza —were accused of sedition by colonial authorities and executed 118 119 this would inspire a propaganda movement in spain organized by marcelo h del pilar josé rizal and mariano ponce lobbying for political reforms in the philippines rizal was eventually executed on december 30 1896 on charges of rebellion 121 as attempts at reform met with resistance andrés bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the katipunan who sought independence from spain through armed revolt 120 bonifacio and the katipunan started the philippine revolution in 1896 a faction of the katipunan the magdalo of cavite province eventually came to challenge bonifacio s position as the leader of the revolution and emilio aguinaldo took over in 1898 the spanish–american war began in cuba and reached the philippines aguinaldo declared philippine independence from spain in kawit cavite on june 12 1898 and the first philippine republic was established in the barasoain church in the following year 89

increasingly clear the united states would not recognize the nascent first philippine republic the philippine–american war broke out the first republic was defeated and the archipelago was administered under an insular government 124 the war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of combatants as well as a couple of hundred thousand civilians mostly from a cholera epidemic 124 125

mainly the waning sultanate of sulu as well as the insurgent tagalog republic the cantonal republic of negros in the visayas and the republic of zamboanga in mindanao 128 129 during this era a renaissance in philippine culture occurred with the expansion of philippine cinema and literature 130 131 132 daniel burnham built an architectural plan for manila which would have transformed it into a modern city 133 in 1935 the philippines was granted commonwealth status with manuel quezon as president he designated a national language and introduced women s suffrage and land reform 134 135

that culminated with the battle of manila 136 in 1944 quezon died in exile in the united states and sergio osmeña succeeded him the allied forces then employed a strategy of island hopping towards the philippine archipelago in the process retaking territory conquered by imperial japan from mid-1942 through mid-1944 the filipino guerrilla resistance 137 138 had been supplied and encouraged by u.s navy submarines and a few parachute drops so that the guerrillas could harass the japanese army and take control of the rural areas jungles and mountains – thus the japanese empire only controlled 12 out of 48 provinces 139 while remaining loyal to the united states many filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence eventually the largest naval battle in history according to gross tonnage sunk the battle of leyte gulf occurred when allied forces started the liberation of the philippines from the japanese empire

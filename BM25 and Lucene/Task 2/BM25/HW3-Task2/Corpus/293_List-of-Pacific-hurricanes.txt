criterion or achieved some statistic or is part of a top ten for some superlative it includes lists and rankings of pacific hurricanes by different characteristics and impacts characteristics include extremes of location such as the northernmost or most equator-ward formation or position of a tropical cyclone other characteristics include its central pressure windspeed category on the saffir–simpson scale cyclogenesis outside of a normal hurricane season s timeframe or storms that remain unnamed despite forming after tropical cyclone naming began in 1960 another characteristic is how long a system went from formation to dissipation these include the cost of damage the number of casualties as well as meteorological statistics such as rainfall point maxima hurricane pauline

north pacific began in the 1960 season that year four lists of names were created the plan was to proceed in a manner similar to that of the western pacific that is the name of the first storm in one season would be the next unused one from the same list and when the bottom of one list was reached the next list was started this scheme was abandoned in 1965 and next year the lists started being recycled on a four-year rotation starting with the a name each year 33 that same general scheme remains in use today although the names and lists are different on average the eastern north pacific sees about sixteen named storms per year 34 named storms per month edit four of the july cyclones during the 2016 season before 1971 and especially 1966 data in this basin is extremely unreliable the

the cphc the storm became extratropical before doing so 35 73 in addition an unofficial cyclone formed on october 30 2006 in the central pacific subtropics it eventually developed an eye-like structure 85 its track data indicates that it crossed from the central to the east pacific because it formed at longitude 149°w and dissipated at 135°w 86 nasa which is not a meteorological organization called this system a subtropical cyclone and the naval research laboratory monterey had enough interest in it to call it 91c 85 the system has also been called extratropical 87 this

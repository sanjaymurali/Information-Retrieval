tropical cyclone formation it is one of the deadliest seasons that have almost killed 640 people so far.north indian ocean cyclone season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between april and december with the two peaks in may and november these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern indian ocean the scope of this article is limited to the indian ocean in the northern hemisphere east of the horn of africa and west of the malay peninsula there are two main seas in the north indian ocean — the arabian sea to the west of the indian subcontinent abbreviated arb by the india meteorological department imd and the bay of bengal to the east abbreviated bob by the imd the official regional specialized meteorological centre in this basin is the imd while the joint typhoon warning center jtwc releases unofficial advisories on average three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every season 1 2 season summary edit the season officially had an early start compared with the last two seasons with the formation of cyclone maarutha over the bay of bengal in mid-april.the strongest storm of the season so far was cyclone mora which formed in late may over the bay of bengal the system made landfall in bangladesh with three-minute sustained winds of 110 km h 70 mph and one-minute sustained winds of 120 km h 75 mph at this strength its peak intensity it was equivalent to a marginal category 1 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale the cyclone produced severe flooding across sri lanka india myanmar and bangladesh and caused 15 deaths directly and 203 deaths indirectly the floods persisted in bangladesh since a deep depression over bay of bengal made landfall and killed 156 people in bangladesh a depression formed in northwestern bay of bengal and produced torrential rainfall it was followed by a depression over jharkhand which killed 70 people in west bengal under the influence of strong monsoon surge a disturbance developed over bay of bengal travelled westwards and intensified to a depression it also affected neighbouring karachi in pakistan seasonal forecast edit over the indian ocean is the risk for at least a couple of tropical systems to make landfall this autumn according to accuweather 3 the best chance for tropical depressions or cyclones in the bay of bengal or the arabian sea will be during october and november during september one or two systems may be declared a depression over the northern bay of bengal and could strike eastern india in west bengal or orissa

north carolina virginia west virginia maryland pennsylvania part of the 1996 atlantic hurricane season hurricane fran caused extensive damage in the united states in early september 1996 the sixth named storm fifth hurricane and fourth major hurricane of the 1996 atlantic hurricane season fran developed from a tropical wave near cape verde on august 23 due to nearby hurricane edouard the depression remained disorganized as it tracked westward though it eventually intensified into tropical storm fran on august 27 while heading west-northwestward fran steadily strengthened into a hurricane on august 29 but weakened back to a tropical storm on the following day on august 31 fran quickly re-intensified into a hurricane by september 2 fran began to parallel the islands of the bahamas and slowly curved north-northwestward fran peaked as a 120 mph 195 km h category 3 hurricane by early on september 5 thereafter fran weakened slightly before it made landfall near cape fear north carolina early on september 6 the storm rapidly weakened inland and was only a tropical depression later that day eventually fran curved east-northeastward and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over ontario early on september 9 in florida high tides capsized a boat with five people aboard though all were rescued no significant effects were reported in georgia the outerbands of fran produced high winds and light to moderate rainfall in south carolina as a result numerous trees and powerlines were downed which damaged cars left over 63,000 people without electricity large waves in north carolina caused significant coastal flooding in some cities overall fran was attributed to 27 fatalities and 3.2 billion 1996 usd in damage fran is also the most recent hurricane to make landfall in the carolinas as a major hurricane 1 2 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale hurricane fran originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of africa entering the atlantic ocean on august 22 1996 not long after moving over water convective banding features formed around a developing area of low pressure ships in the vicinity of the system confirmed that a surface circulation had formed later that day after further development the national hurricane center nhc initiated advisories on the system around 8 00 am edt on august 23 designating it as tropical depression six at this time the depression was situated to the southeast of the cape verde islands over the following several days little development took place as the system moved westward at 17 mph 27 km h the westward motion and lack of development were attributed to the low-level inflow from hurricane edouard located roughly 850 mi 1,370 km west-northwest of the depression 3 by august 26 the depression had become significantly disorganized prompting the nhc to issue their initial final advisory on the system 4 the following day satellite imagery depicted an improved circulation leading to the re-issuance of advisories 5 however post-storm analysis indicated that the system maintained tropical depression status during the 24‑hour span during the afternoon of august 27 the depression intensified further becoming a tropical storm and receiving the name fran at this time tropical storm fran was located about 1,000 mi 1,600 km east of the lesser antilles following a similar track as edouard the newly named storm maintained a west-northwest track while gaining strength 3 colorized infrared image of fran near peak intensity east of the northern bahamas and florida following the development of deep convection around fran s center of circulation on august 29 the nhc upgraded it to a category 1 hurricane the lowest ranking on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale with winds of 75 mph 120 km h however the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm on august 30 as it became less organized possibly due to an interaction with hurricane edouard to the north during this time the forward motion of the storm significantly decreased and it took a more northwestward track however this weakening was short-lived and fran re-attained hurricane status the following day as edouard moved towards the mid-atlantic coastline the storm also resumed its west-northwest movement as a subtropical ridge to the north strengthened 3 infrared image of fran making landfall near cape fear north carolina on september 5 gradual intensification took place for the first several days of september with fran attaining winds of 90 mph 150 km h on september 3 by this point the storm began to develop an eye and a more rapid phase of strengthening took place early the next day fran attained category 3 intensity as its maximum sustained winds increased to 115 mph 185 km h a more northwesterly track also began to appear as it approached the bahamas passing roughly 115 mi 185 km east of the bahamas fran attained its peak intensity on september 5 with winds of 120 mi h 195 km h and a barometric pressure of 946 mbar hpa 27.94 inhg the eye of fran was roughly 29 mi 47 km in diameter at this time 3 a large hurricane the storm s forward motion increased as it moved northwest towards the carolinas around 7 30  pm edt on thursday september 5 6 the center of hurricane fran made landfall near cape fear north carolina with sustained winds of 115 mph 185 km h once overland the storm began to rapidly weaken degrading to a tropical storm within 12 hours as the weakening storm moved through virginia the nhc further downgraded it to a tropical depression continuing on a northwestern track the remnants of fran persisted as a tropical depression through september 8 at which time it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over southern ontario after completing this transition fran turned northeastward and tracked near the canadian-united states border before being absorbed by a frontal system on september 10 3 preparations edit lesser antilles and the bahamas edit general hurricane warning hurricane conditions expected within 36 hours hurricane watch hurricane conditions possible within 48

antilles on august 29 a hurricane watch was issued for the northernmost of the islands between antigua and saint martin 7 however as the hurricane weakened and pulled away from the islands to the northwest the watch was discontinued at the same time a hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning was declared for the central bahamas on september 3 the hurricane watch was extended to include the northern bahamas and a hurricane warning was declared for the northwestern islands all watches for the bahamas were cancelled on september 4 7 no preparations were taken by the government of the bahamas in anticipation of fran 8 florida edit early in its span hurricane fran was forecast to heavily impact florida and multiple watches and warnings were issued for the state as hurricane fran neared the united states 7 as the hurricane progressively moved further to the north watches and warnings imposed on florida continued to move further north along the coast on september 4 a tropical storm warning was issued but only from brunswick georgia to flagler beach florida located in the northern parts of the state all watches and warnings on the state were discontinued by september 5 citation needed before the hurricane neared the coast civil defense authorities conducted statewide conference calls in order to create preliminary plans in case fran caused impacts on florida 9 in addition beach patrols were kept on high alert as fran generated large waves on the florida beaches 10 georgia edit the first hurricane watches and warnings for georgia were first imposed on september 4 as hurricane fran became a major hurricane with a watch extending from florida through georgia and into south carolina 7 the watch was upgraded to a warning later that day as fran moved closer to

sign put up by a resident of north carolina topsail island following the severe damage from fran the cape fear river watershed was devastated by fran severe water quality problems persisted for weeks the northeast cape fear river suffered a massive fish kill sewage treatment plant failures led to millions of liters of raw and partially treated human sewage to flow into area rivers dissolved oxygen content fell to nearly zero across the cape fear and northeast cape fear rivers for over three weeks which led to hypoxia in the cape fear estuary for several weeks ammonium and phosphorus levels increased with concentrations of phosphorus reaching a 27-year high 39 retirement edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names because of the damage in north carolina the virginias and elsewhere in the united states the name fran was retired in the spring of 1997 and will never again be used for another atlantic hurricane it was replaced with fay in the 2002 season

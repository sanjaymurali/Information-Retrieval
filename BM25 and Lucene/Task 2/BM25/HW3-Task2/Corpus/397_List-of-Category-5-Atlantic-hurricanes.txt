list of category 5 atlantic hurricanes wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search hurricane isabel as seen from the international space station in september 2003 a total of 33 recorded tropical cyclones have reached category 5 strength on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale in the atlantic ocean north of the equator the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico hurricanes of such intensity occur once every three years in this region on average only six times—in the 1932 1933 1961 2005 2007 and 2017 hurricane seasons—has more than one category 5 recorded hurricane formed only in 2005 have more than two category 5 hurricanes formed and only in 2007 and 2017 did more than one make landfall at category 5 strength 1 background saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale td ts c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 tracks of all known category 5 atlantic hurricanes between 1851 and 2014 a category 5 atlantic hurricane is one that is considered by the united states national hurricane center nhc to have had sustained wind speeds greater than 136 knots 157 mph 252 km h 70 m s on the saffir–simpson scale the nhc considers sustained wind speeds to be those that occur over a one-minute period at 10 metres 32.8 ft above ground these wind speeds are estimated by using a blend of data from a variety of sources which include observations from nearby ships reconnaissance aircraft or automatic weather stations and pictures from various satellites between 1924 and 2017 33 hurricanes were recorded at category 5 strength no category 5 hurricanes were observed officially before 1924 it can be presumed that earlier storms reached category 5 strength over open waters but the strongest winds were not measured the anemometer a device used for measuring wind speed was invented in 1846 however during major hurricane strikes the instruments as a whole were often blown away leaving the hurricane s peak intensity unrecorded for example as the great beaufort hurricane of 1879 struck north carolina the anemometer cups were blown away when indicating 138 mph 222 km h 2 a reanalysis of weather data is ongoing by researchers who may upgrade or downgrade other atlantic hurricanes currently listed at categories 4 and 5 3 for example the 1825 santa ana hurricane is suspected to have reached category 5 strength 4 furthermore paleotempestological research aims to identify past major hurricanes by comparing sedimentary evidence of recent and past hurricane strikes for example a giant hurricane significantly more powerful than hurricane hattie category 5 has been identified in belizean sediment having struck the region sometime before 1500 5 an october category 5 that hit cuba in 1924 officially the decade with the most category 5 hurricanes is 2000–2009 with eight category 5 hurricanes having occurred isabel 2003 ivan 2004 emily 2005 katrina 2005 rita 2005 wilma 2005 dean 2007 and felix 2007 the previous decades with the most category 5 hurricanes were the 1930s and 1960s with six occurring between 1930 and 1939 before naming began 1 nine atlantic hurricanes—camille allen andrew isabel ivan dean felix irma and maria—reached category 5 intensity on more than one occasion that is by reaching category 5 intensity weakening to a category 4 or lower and then becoming a category 5 again such hurricanes have their dates shown together camille andrew dean felix irma and maria each attained category 5 status twice during their lifespans allen isabel and ivan reached category 5 intensity on three separate occasions however no atlantic hurricane has reached category 5 intensity more than three times during its lifespan the november 1932 cuba hurricane holds the record for most time spent as a category 5 although it took place before satellite or aircraft reconnaissance so this record may be somewhat suspect irma holds the record for longest continuous span as a category 5 in the satellite era 1 6 thirty-three category 5s have been recorded in the atlantic basin since 1851 when records began only one category 5 has been recorded in july eight in august nineteen in september five in october and one in november there have been no officially recorded june or off-season category 5 hurricanes 1 the july and august category 5s reached their high intensities in both the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea these are the areas most favorable for tropical cyclone development in those months 1 7 september sees the most category 5 hurricanes this coincides with the climatological peak of the atlantic hurricane season which occurs in early september 8 september category 5s reached their strengths in any of the gulf of mexico caribbean sea and open atlantic these places are where september tropical cyclones are likely to form 7 many of these hurricanes are either cape verde-type storms which develop their strength by having a great deal of open water or so-called bahama busters which intensify over the warm loop current in the gulf of mexico 9 all six category 5s in october and november reached their intensities in the western caribbean a region that atlantic hurricanes strongly gravitate toward late in the season 7 this is due to the climatology of the area which sometimes has a high-altitude anticyclone that promotes rapid intensification late in the season as well as warm waters systems name dates

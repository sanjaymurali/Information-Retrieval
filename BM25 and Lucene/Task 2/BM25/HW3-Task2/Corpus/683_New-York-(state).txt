border with the canadian provinces of quebec to the north and ontario to the northwest the southern part of the state consists of long island and several smaller associated islands as well as new york city and the lower hudson river valley most of which lie within the wider atlantic coastal plain the large region known as upstate new york consists of several ranges of the wider appalachian mountains including the allegheny plateau and catskills along new york s southern tier and the adirondack mountains in the northeastern lobe of the state these more mountainous regions are bisected by two major river valleys—the north-south hudson river valley and the east-west mohawk river valley which forms the core of the erie canal western new york is considered part of the great lakes region and straddles lake ontario and lake erie between the two lakes lies niagara falls the central part of the state is dominated by the finger lakes a popular vacation and tourist destination new york had been inhabited by tribes of algonquian and iroquoian-speaking native americans for several hundred years by the time the earliest europeans came to new york french colonists and jesuit missionaries arrived southward from montreal for trade and proselytizing in 1609 the region was visited by henry hudson sailing for the dutch east india company the dutch built fort nassau in 1614 at the confluence of the hudson and mohawk rivers where the present-day capital of albany later developed the dutch soon also settled new amsterdam and parts of the hudson valley establishing the multicultural colony of new netherland a center of trade and immigration england seized the colony from the dutch in 1664 during the american revolutionary war 1775–1783 a group of colonists of the province of new york attempted to take control of the british colony and eventually succeeded in establishing independence many landmarks in new york are well known including four of the world s ten

university which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world 33 34 history main article history of new york state native american history the tribes in what is now new york were predominantly iroquois and algonquin long island was divided roughly in half between the wampanoag and lenape the lenape also controlled most of the region surrounding new york harbor north of the lenape was a third algonquin nation the mohicans starting north of them from east to west were three iroquoian nations the mohawk the original iroquois and the petun south of them divided roughly along appalachia were the susquehannock and the erie 35 36 37 38 39 40 many of the wampanoag and mohican peoples were caught up in king phillip s war a joint effort of many new england tribes to push europeans off their land after the death of their leader chief phillip metcomet most of those peoples fled inland splitting into the abenaki and the schaghticoke many of the mohicans remained in the region until the 1800s however 41 the mohawk and susquehannock were the most militaristic trying to corner trade with the europeans they targeted other tribes the mohawk were also known for refusing white settlement on their land and banishing any of their people who converted to christianity they posed a major threat to the abenaki and mohicans while the susquehannock briefly conquered the lenape in the 1600s the most devastating event of the century however was the beaver wars from approximately 1640–1680 iroquoian peoples waged campaigns which extended from modern day michigan to virginia against algonquin and siouan tribes as well as each other the aim was to control more land for animal trapping a career most natives had turned to in hopes of trading with whites first not only did this completely change the ethnography of the region most large game was hunted out before whites ever fully explored the land still afterward the iroquois confederacy offered shelter to refugees of the mascouten erie chonnonton tutelo saponi and tuscarora nations in the 1700s they would also merge with the mohawk during the french-indian war and take in the remaining susquehannock of pennsylvania after they were decimated in war 42 most of these other groups blended in until they ceased to exist then after the revolution a large group of them split off and returned to ohio becoming known as the mingo seneca the current six tribes of the iroquois confederacy are the seneca cayuga onondaga oneida tuscarora and mohawk as the iroquois sided with the british during the revolution they soon after migrated to canada 43 44 meanwhile the lenape formed a close relationship with william penn however upon penn s death his sons managed to take over much of their lands and banish them to ohio 45 when the u.s drafted the indian removal act the lenape were further moved to missouri whereas their cousins the mohicans were sent to wisconsin 16th century in 1524 giovanni da verrazzano an italian explorer in the service of the french crown explored the atlantic coast of north america between the carolinas and newfoundland including new york harbor and narragansett bay on april 17 1524 verrazanno entered new york bay by way of the strait now called the narrows into the northern bay which he named santa margherita in honor of the king of france s sister verrazzano described it as a vast coastline with a deep delta in which every kind of ship could pass and he adds that it extends inland for a league and opens up to form a beautiful lake this vast sheet of water swarmed with native boats he landed on the tip of manhattan and possibly on the furthest point of long island verrazanno s stay was interrupted by a storm which pushed him north towards martha s vineyard 46 in 1540 french traders from new france built a chateau on castle island within present-day albany due to flooding it was abandoned the next year in 1614 the dutch under the command of hendrick corstiaensen rebuilt the french chateau which they called fort nassau fort nassau was the first dutch settlement in north america and was located along the hudson river also within present-day albany the small fort served as a trading post and warehouse located on the hudson river flood plain the rudimentary fort was washed away by flooding in 1617 47 and abandoned for good after fort orange new netherland was built nearby in 1623 48 17th century see also province of new york new amsterdam present-day lower manhattan 1660 henry hudson s 1609 voyage marked the beginning of european involvement with the area sailing for the dutch east india company and looking for a passage to asia he entered the upper new york bay on september 11 of that year 49 word of his findings encouraged dutch merchants to explore the coast in search for profitable fur trading with local native american tribes during the 17th century dutch trading posts established for the trade of pelts from the lenape iroquois and other tribes were founded in the colony of new netherland the first of these trading posts were fort nassau 1614 near present-day albany fort orange 1624 on the hudson river just south of the current city of albany and created to replace fort nassau developing into settlement beverwijck 1647 and into what became albany fort amsterdam 1625 to develop into the town new amsterdam which is present-day new york city and esopus 1653 now kingston the success of the patroonship of rensselaerswyck 1630 which surrounded albany and lasted until the mid-19th century was also a key factor in the early success of the colony the english captured the colony during the second anglo-dutch war and governed it as the province of new york the city of new york was recaptured by the dutch in 1673 during the third anglo-dutch war 1672–1674 and renamed new orange it was returned to the english under the terms of the treaty of westminster a year later 50 18th century the american revolution and statehood new york and neighboring jurisdictions in 1777 the sons of liberty were organized in new york city during the 1760s largely in response to the oppressive stamp act passed by the british parliament in 1765 the stamp act congress met in the city on october 19 of that year composed of representatives from across the thirteen colonies who set the stage for the continental congress to follow the stamp act congress resulted in the declaration of rights and grievances which was the first written expression by representatives of the americans of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the united states declaration of independence this included the right to representative government at the same time given strong trading between britain and the united states on both business and personal levels many new york residents were loyalists the capture of fort ticonderoga provided the cannon and gunpowder necessary to force a british withdrawal from the siege of boston in 1775 new york was the only colony to not vote for independence as the delegates were not authorized to do so new york then endorsed the declaration of independence on july 9 1776 51 the new york state constitution was framed by a convention which assembled at white plains on july 10 1776 and after repeated adjournments and changes of location terminated its labors at kingston on sunday evening april 20 1777 when the new constitution drafted by john jay was adopted with but one dissenting vote it was not submitted to the people for ratification on july 30 1777 george clinton was inaugurated as the first governor of new york at kingston about one-third of the battles of the american revolutionary war took place in new york the first major battle after u.s independence was declared—and the largest battle of the entire war—was fought in new york at the battle of long island a.k.a battle of brooklyn in august 1776 after their victory the british occupied new york city making it their military and political base of operations in north america for the duration of the conflict and consequently the focus of general george washington s intelligence network on the notorious british prison ships of wallabout bay more american combatants died of intentional neglect than were killed in combat in every battle of the war combined both sides of combatants lost more soldiers to disease than to outright wounds the first of two major british armies were captured by the continental army at the battle of saratoga in 1777 a success that influenced france to ally with the revolutionaries.the state constitution was enacted in 1777 new york became the 11th state to ratify the united states constitution on july 26 1788 preceded by virginia list of u.s states by date of statehood ratified constitution on july 26 1788 11th succeeded by north carolina british general john burgoyne surrenders at saratoga in 1777 in an attempt to retain their sovereignty and remain an independent nation positioned between the new united states and british north america four of the iroquois nations fought on the side of the british only the oneida and their dependents the tuscarora allied themselves with the americans 52 in retaliation for attacks on the frontier led by joseph brant and loyalist mohawk forces the sullivan expedition of 1779 destroyed nearly 50 iroquois villages adjacent croplands and winter stores forcing many refugees to british-held niagara 53 as allies of the british the iroquois were forced out of new york although they had not been part of treaty negotiations they resettled in canada after the war and were given land grants by the crown in the treaty settlement the british ceded most indian lands to the new united states because new york made treaty with the iroquois without getting congressional approval some of the land purchases have been subject to land claim suits since the late 20th century by the federally recognized tribes new york put up more than 5 million acres 20,000 km2 of former iroquois territory for sale in the years after the revolutionary war leading to rapid development in upstate new york 54 as per the treaty of paris the last vestige of british authority in the former thirteen colonies—their troops in new york city—departed in 1783 which was long afterward celebrated as evacuation day 55 1800 map of new york from low s encyclopaedia new york city was the national capital under the articles of confederation and perpetual union the first government that organization was found to be insufficient and prominent new yorker alexander hamilton advocated a new government that would include an executive national courts and the power to tax hamilton led the annapolis convention 1786 that called for the philadelphia convention which drafted the united states constitution in which he also took part the new government was to be a strong federal national government to replace the relatively weaker confederation of individual states following heated debate which included the publication of the now quintessential constitutional interpretation—the federalist papers—as a series of installments in new york city newspapers new york was the 11th state to ratify the united states constitution on july 26 1788 56 new york remained the national capital under the new constitution until 1790 and was the site of the inauguration of president george washington the drafting of the united states bill of rights and the first session of the united states supreme court hamilton s revival of the heavily indebted united states economy after the war and the creation of a national bank significantly contributed to new york city becoming the financial center of the new nation both the dutch and the british imported african slaves as laborers to the city and colony new york had the second-highest population of slaves after charleston south carolina slavery was extensive in new york city and some agricultural areas the state passed a law for the gradual abolition of slavery soon after the revolutionary war but the last slave in new york was not freed until 1827 19th century the erie canal at lockport new york in 1839 transportation in western new york was by expensive wagons on muddy roads before canals opened up the rich farm lands to long-distance traffic governor dewitt clinton promoted the erie canal that connected new york city to the great lakes by the hudson river the new canal and the rivers and lakes work commenced in 1817 and the erie canal opened in 1825 packet boats pulled by horses on tow paths traveled slowly over the canal carrying passengers and freight 57 farm products came in from the midwest and finished manufactured moved west it was an engineering marvel which opened up vast areas of new york to commerce and settlement it enabled great lakes port cities such as buffalo and rochester to grow and prosper it also connected the burgeoning agricultural production of the midwest and shipping on the great lakes with the port of new york city improving transportation it enabled additional population migration to territories west of new york after 1850 railroads largely replaced the canal 58 new york city was a major ocean port and had extensive traffic importing cotton from the south and exporting manufacturing goods nearly half of the state s exports were related to cotton southern cotton factors planters and bankers visited so often that they had favorite hotels 59 at the same time activism for abolitionism was strong upstate where some communities provided stops on the underground railroad upstate and new york city gave strong support for the american civil war in terms of finances volunteer soldiers and supplies the state provided more than 370,000 soldiers to the union armies over 53,000 new yorkers died in service roughly one of every seven who served however irish draft riots in 1862 were a significant embarrassment 60 61 immigration further information ellis island ellis island in 1905 play media scenes at the immigration depot and a nearby dock on ellis island since the early 19th century new york city has been the largest port of entry for legal immigration into the united states in the united states the federal government did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until 1890 prior to this time the matter was delegated to the individual states then via contract between the states and the federal government most immigrants to new york would disembark at the bustling docks along the hudson and east rivers in the eventual lower manhattan on may 4 1847 the new york state legislature created the board of commissioners of immigration to regulate immigration 62 the first permanent immigration depot in new york was established in 1855 at castle garden a converted war of 1812 era fort located within what is now battery park at the tip of lower manhattan the first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from quarantine castle garden served as new york s immigrant depot until it closed on april 18 1890 when the federal government assumed control over immigration during that period more than 8 million immigrants passed through its doors two out of every three u.s immigrants 63 when the federal government assumed control it established the bureau of immigration which chose the three-acre ellis island in upper new york harbor for an entry depot already federally controlled the island had served as an ammunition depot it was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to new york city and the rail lines of jersey city new jersey via a short ferry ride while the island was being developed and expanded via land reclamation the federal government operated a temporary depot at the barge office at the battery 64 ellis island opened on january 1 1892 and operated as a central immigration center until the national origins act was passed in 1924 reducing immigration after that date the only immigrants to pass through were displaced persons or war refugees the island ceased all immigration processing on november 12 1954 when the last person detained on the island norwegian seaman arne peterssen was released he had overstayed his shore leave and left on the 10 15 a.m manhattan-bound ferry to return to his ship more than 12 million immigrants passed through ellis island between 1892 and 1954 more than 100 million americans across the united states can trace their ancestry to these immigrants ellis island was the subject of a contentious and long-running border and jurisdictional dispute between new york state and the state of new jersey as both claimed it the issue was settled in 1998 by the u.s supreme court which ruled that the original 3.3-acre 1.3 ha island was new york state territory and that the balance of the 27.5 acres 11 ha added after 1834 by landfill was in new jersey 65 the island was added to the national park service system in may 1965 by president lyndon b johnson and is still owned by the federal government as part of the statue of liberty national monument ellis island was opened to the public as a museum of immigration in 1990 66 september 11 2001 attacks flight 175 hit the original south tower on september 11 2001 main article september 11 attacks on september 11 2001 two of four hijacked planes were flown into the twin towers of the original world trade center in lower manhattan and the towers collapsed 7 world trade center also collapsed due to damage from fires the other buildings of the world trade center complex were damaged beyond repair and demolished soon thereafter the collapse of the twin towers caused extensive damage and resulted in the deaths of 2,753 victims including 147 aboard the two planes since september 11 most of lower manhattan has been restored in the years since many rescue workers and residents of the area have developed several life-threatening illnesses and some have died 67 a memorial at the site the national september 11 memorial museum was opened to the public on september 11 2011 a permanent museum later opened at the site on march 21 2014 upon its completion in 2014 the new one world trade center became the tallest skyscraper in the western hemisphere at 1,776 feet 541 m 68 other skyscrapers are under construction at the site hurricane sandy 2012 main article effects of hurricane sandy in new york flooding on avenue c in lower manhattan caused by hurricane sandy on october 29 and 30 2012 hurricane sandy caused extensive destruction of the state s shorelines ravaging portions of new york city and long island with record-high storm surge with severe flooding and high winds causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of new yorkers and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems the storm and its profound effects have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of new york city and long island to minimize the risk from another such future event this is considered highly probable due to global warming and rise in sea levels 69 70 enveloped by the atlantic ocean and long island sound new york city and long island alone are home to approximately 11 million residents conjointly the

marcy in the adirondacks at 5,344 feet 1,629 meters above sea level while the state s lowest point is at sea level on the atlantic ocean 71 in contrast with new york city s urban landscape the vast majority of the state s geographic area is dominated by meadows forests rivers farms mountains and lakes most of the southern part of the state rests on the allegheny plateau which extends from the southeastern united states to the catskill mountains the section in new york state is known as the southern tier the rugged adirondack mountains with vast tracts of wilderness lie west of the lake champlain valley the great appalachian valley dominates eastern new york and contains the lake champlain valley as its northern half and the hudson valley as its southern half within the state the tug hill region arises as a cuesta east of lake ontario 72 upstate and downstate are often used informally to distinguish new york city or its greater metropolitan area from the rest of new york state the placement of a boundary between the two is a matter of great contention 73 unofficial and loosely defined regions of upstate new york include the southern tier which often includes the counties along the border with pennsylvania 74 and the north country which can mean anything from the strip along the canada–us border to everything north of the mohawk river 75 new york contains a part of the

border with rhode island except for areas near the new york harbor new york has a mostly land boarder with two mid-atlantic states new jersey and pennsylvania new york is the only state that includes within its borders parts of the great lakes and the atlantic ocean drainage the hudson river begins near lake tear of the clouds and flows south through the eastern part of the state without draining lakes george or champlain lake george empties at its north end into lake champlain whose northern end extends into canada where it drains into the richelieu river and then ultimately the saint

region in general new york has a humid continental climate though under the köppen climate classification new york city has a humid subtropical climate 79 weather in new york is heavily influenced by two continental air masses a warm humid one from the southwest and a cold dry one from the northwest downstate new york comprising new york city long island and lower portions of the hudson valley has rather warm summers with some periods of high humidity and cold damp winters which however are relatively mild compared to temperatures in upstate new york secondary to the former region s lower elevation proximity to the atlantic ocean and relatively lower latitude compared to the latter upstate new york experiences warm summers marred by only occasional brief intervals of sultry conditions with long and cold winters western new york particularly the tug hill region receives heavy lake-effect snows especially during the earlier portions of winter before the surface of lake ontario itself is covered by ice the summer climate is cool in the adirondacks catskills and at higher elevations of the southern tier summer daytime temperatures usually range from the upper 70s to mid-80s °f 25 to 30 °c over much of the state in the majority of winter seasons a temperature of −13 °f −25 °c or lower can be expected in the northern highlands northern plateau and 5 °f −15 °c or colder in the southwestern and east-central highlands of the southern tier new york ranks 46th among the 50 states in the amount of greenhouse gases generated per person this relative efficient energy usage is primarily due to the dense compact settlement in the new york city metropolitan area and the state population s high rate of mass transit use in this area and between major cities 80 ecology further

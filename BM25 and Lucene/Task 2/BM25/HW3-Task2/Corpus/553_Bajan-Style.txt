sandé they described their experience with her saying that was one of our first sessions and it was great to work with her she’s an amazing writer and vocalist what an incredible voice it was a feel-good song as we like to write feelgood music the reason we didn’t go with it was because it wasn’t completely cover drive and we wanted the first album to really reflect us and represent us 100 that song is amazing but it wouldn’t have worked on the album we’ve made the band described bajan style as a beach party in barbados and guaranteed sand in your shoes lead singer amanda explained our

critics becca longmire of entertainmentwise applauded the album describing it as a job well done she continued saying amanda has a pretty rare quality in the fact that she has the ability to flip from a ballad such as their chart topper twilight to a slightly sassier rihanna style track such as debut single lick ya down the tracks that stand out the most have to be title track bajan style which definitely shows off the band s barbados roots and another slightly more upbeat track headphones which emphasises the band s musical ability and raw talent with lyrics such as boy i want to put you on repeat you will be the bass of my heartbeat.. it s easy to compare amanda to fellow bajan beauty rihanna however this band definitely have their own sound and the album has some sure fire catchy hits 11 krystal scanlon of gigwise gave the album a positive review commenting cover drive’s first three singles have already scored barbadian band huge hit singles so it was obvious the band have already got their career off to a good start she continued saying the opening track bajan style intro is just a perfect taster of what the album has to offer with a hint of an early black eyed peas tone to some of their songs this album offers its listeners a variety of solid beats catchy lyrics and an overall good feeling the background beat of headphones holds a similar style of tune to no doubt s hey baby – so if you’re a fan of the lovely gwen stefani this is definitely worth a try lick ya down rivals rihanna for the radio-friendly sounds heard on her recent album but that said cover drive still have their own unique style and this song is equally catchy just like the rest of this album with their front girl amanda being labeled the new bajan queen of the music scene rihanna is definitely going to have a little competition on her hands in the charts wrongside is another standout tune and has a vibe similar to shaggy’s it wasn t me with the backing rhythm while a lot of these songs do have a catchy beat and could be considered similar it’s safe to say there is still a lot of variety amongst the songs – from calmer slow songs to upbeat songs that make you want to dance cover drive are definitely some way from their pop peak on this their first album but there’s no doubt that this is going to set the bar high it’ll be interesting to see what song they release next because they certainly have a good set to choose from 12 lewis corner of digital spy awarded the album three out of five stars commenting from the off it s clear the group have been influenced by other mixed quartets no doubt and the black eyed peas as such singer amanda reifer serves as the fergie gwen stefani and takes the lead on the majority of the tracks she can flip from butter-wouldn t-melt on mid-tempo love song twilight to passionate and sassy on debut single lick ya down in an instant and she pulls it off with ease however it s headphones that showcases the band s real ability as musicians boy i want to put you on repeat you will be the bass of my heartbeat amanda swoons over bouncy beats and funk-driven guitar riffs packed with more tropical flavour and sweetness than an ice-cold can of lilt sparks proves they are more than capable of taking on the trickier ballads producing an ear-snagging pop melody with a floating piano riff and radio-friendly vocals penultimate cut hurricane injects a welcome burst of back-end energy after non-starters wrongside and can t live in a world begin to pull things down like all good cricket matches there may be quiet spells during the game but it s only the final result that really matters luckily for cover drive their very first innings contains some very memorable hits 13 alex macpherson of the guardian awarded the album three out of five stars saying the summer dancehall hit once an annual staple of the british charts has been on a hiatus in recent years – as bajan four-piece cover drive have spotted their compatriot rihanna may have long abandoned reggae-lite pop for foghorn electro but her early years provide fertile inspiration for cover drive from the steel pans and airhorns of breakthrough hit lick ya down to the fluttering yearning explode lead singer amanda reifer could be mistaken for rihanna albeit a less charismatic version – a quality that also explains why cover drive s breezy beach party-vibes are highly likable but a bit lightweight still in an era when most pop stars strategy is to bludgeon you into submission that s refreshing 14 track listing edit no title writer s producer s length 1 bajan

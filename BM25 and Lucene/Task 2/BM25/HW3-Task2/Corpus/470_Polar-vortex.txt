2014 low pressure area over quebec and maine part of the northern polar vortex weakening on the record-setting cold morning of january 21 1985 a polar vortex is an upper level low-pressure area lying near the earth s pole there are two polar vortices in the earth s atmosphere which overlie the north and south poles each polar vortex is a persistent large-scale low pressure zone that rotates counter-clockwise at the north pole called a cyclone and clockwise at the south pole the bases of the two polar vortices are located in the middle and upper troposphere and extend into the stratosphere beneath that lies a large mass of cold dense arctic air the vortices weaken and strengthen from year to year when the vortex of the arctic is strong it is well defined there is a single vortex and the arctic air is well contained when weaker which it generally is it will break into two or more vortices when very weak the flow of arctic air becomes more disorganized and masses of cold arctic air can push equatorward bringing with it a rapid and sharp temperature drop the interface between the cold dry air mass of the pole and the warm moist air mass further south defines the location of the polar front the polar front is centered roughly at 60° latitude a polar vortex strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer due to its dependence on the temperature difference between the equator and the poles 1 the vortices span less than 1,000 kilometers 620 miles in diameter within which they rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and in a clockwise fashion in the southern hemisphere as with other cyclones their rotation is driven by the coriolis effect when the polar vortex is strong there is a single vortex with a jet stream that is well constrained near the polar front when the northern vortex weakens it separates into two or more vortices the strongest of which are near baffin island canada and the other over northeast siberia 2 the antarctic vortex of the southern hemisphere is a single low pressure zone that is found near the edge of the ross ice shelf near 160 west longitude when the polar vortex is strong the mid-latitude westerlies winds at the surface level between 30° and 60° latitude from the west increase in strength and are persistent when the polar vortex is weak high pressure zones of the mid latitudes may push poleward moving the polar vortex jet stream and polar front equatorward the jet stream is seen to buckle and deviate south this rapidly brings cold dry air into contact with the warm moist air of the mid latitudes resulting in a rapid and dramatic change of weather known as a cold snap 3 ozone depletion occurs within the polar vortices – particularly over the southern hemisphere – reaching a maximum depletion in the spring history edit the polar vortex was first described as early as 1853 4 the phenomenon s sudden stratospheric warming ssw develops during the winter in the northern hemisphere and was discovered in 1952 with radiosonde observations at altitudes higher than 20 km 5 the phenomenon was mentioned frequently in the news and weather media in the cold north american winter of 2013-2014 popularizing the term as an explanation of very cold temperatures 6 identification edit polar cyclones are low pressure zones embedded within the polar air masses and exist year-round the stratospheric polar vortex develops at latitudes above the subtropical jet stream 7 horizontally most polar vortices have a radius of less than 1,000 kilometres 620 mi 8 since polar vortices exist from the stratosphere downward into the mid-troposphere 2 a variety of heights pressure levels are used to mark its position the 50 mb pressure surface is most often used to identify its stratospheric location 9 at the level of the tropopause the extent of closed contours of potential temperature can be used to determine its strength others have used levels down to the 500 hpa pressure level about 5,460 metres 17,910 ft above sea level during the winter to identify the polar vortex 10 duration and power edit polar vortex and weather impacts due to stratospheric warming polar vortices are weakest during summer and strongest during winter extratropical cyclones that migrate into higher latitudes when the polar vortex is weak can disrupt the single vortex creating smaller vortices cold-core lows within the polar air mass 11 those individual vortices can persist for more than a month 8 volcanic eruptions in the tropics can lead to a stronger polar vortex during winter for as long as two years afterwards 12 the strength and position of the polar vortex shapes the flow pattern in a broad area about it an index which is used in the northern hemisphere to gauge its magnitude is the arctic oscillation 13 when the arctic vortex is at its strongest there is a single vortex but normally the arctic vortex is elongated in shape with two cyclone centers one over baffin island in canada and the other over northeast siberia when the arctic pattern is at its weakest subtropic air masses can intrude poleward causing the arctic air masses to move equatorward as during the winter 1985 arctic outbreak 14 the antarctic polar vortex is more pronounced and persistent than the arctic one in the arctic the distribution of land masses at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere gives rise to rossby waves which contribute to the breakdown of the polar vortex whereas in the southern hemisphere the vortex is less disturbed the breakdown of the polar vortex is an extreme event known as a sudden stratospheric warming here the vortex completely breaks down and an associated warming of 30–50 °c 54–90 °f over a few days can occur the waxing and waning of the polar vortex is driven by the movement of mass and the transfer of heat in the polar region in the autumn the circumpolar winds increase in speed and the polar vortex rises into the stratosphere the result is the polar air forms a coherent rotating air mass the polar vortex as winter approaches the vortex core cools the winds decrease and the vortex energy declines once late winter and early spring approach the vortex is at its weakest as a result during late winter large fragments of the vortex air can be diverted into lower latitudes by stronger weather systems intruding from those latitudes in the lowest level of the stratosphere strong potential vorticity gradients remain and the majority of that air remains confined within the polar air mass into december in the southern hemisphere and april in the northern hemisphere well after the breakup of the vortex in the mid-stratosphere 15 the breakup of the northern polar vortex occurs between mid march to mid may this event signifies the transition from winter to spring and has impacts on the hydrological cycle growing seasons of vegetation and overall ecosystem productivity the timing of the transition also influences changes in sea ice ozone air temperature and cloudiness early and late polar breakup episodes have occurred due to variations in the stratospheric flow structure and upward spreading of planetary waves from the troposphere clarification needed as a result of increased waves into the vortex the vortex experiences more rapid warming than normal resulting in an earlier breakup and spring when the breakup comes early it is characterized by with persistent of remnants of the vortex when the breakup is late the remnants dissipate rapidly when the breakup is early there is one warming period from late february to middle march when the breakup is late there are two warming periods one january and one in march zonal mean temperature wind and geopotential height exert varying deviations from their normal values before and after early breakups while the deviations remain constant before and after late breakups scientists are connecting a delay in the arctic vortex breakup with a reduction of planetary wave activities few stratospheric sudden warming events and depletion of ozone 16 17 clarification needed sudden stratospheric warming events are associated with weaker polar vortices this warming of stratospheric air can reverse the circulation in the arctic polar vortex from counter-clockwise to clockwise 18 these changes aloft force changes in the troposphere below 19 an example of an effect on the troposphere is the change in speed of the atlantic ocean circulation pattern a soft spot just south of greenland is where the initial step of downwelling occurs nicknamed the achilles heel of the north atlantic small amounts of heating or cooling traveling from the polar vortex can trigger or delay downwelling altering the gulf stream current of the atlantic and the speed of other ocean currents since all other oceans depend on the atlantic ocean s movement of heat energy climates across the planet can be dramatically affected the weakening or strengthening of the polar vortex can alter the sea circulation more than a mile beneath the waves 20 strengthening storm systems within the troposphere that cool the poles intensify the polar vortex la niña–related climate anomalies significantly strengthen the polar vortex 21 intensification of the polar vortex produces changes in relative humidity as downward intrusions of dry stratospheric air enter the vortex core with a strengthening of the vortex comes a longwave cooling due to a decrease in water vapor concentration near the vortex the decreased water content is a result of a lower tropopause within the vortex which places dry stratospheric air above moist tropospheric air 22 instability is caused when the vortex tube the line of concentrated vorticity is displaced when this occurs the vortex rings become more unstable and prone to shifting by planetary waves.the planetary wave activity in both hemispheres varies year-to-year producing a corresponding response in the strength and temperature of the polar vortex 23 the number of waves around the perimeter of the vortex are related to the core size as the vortex core decreases the number of waves increase 24 the degree of the mixing of polar and mid-latitude air depends on the evolution and position of the polar night jet in general the mixing is less inside the vortex than outside mixing occurs with unstable planetary waves that are characteristic of the middle and upper stratosphere in winter prior to vortex breakdown there is little transport of air out of the arctic polar vortex due to strong barriers above 420 km 261 miles the polar night jet which exists below this is weak in the early winter as a result it does not deviate any descending polar air which then mixes with air in the mid-latitudes in the late winter air parcels do not descend as much reducing mixing 25 after the vortex is broken up the ex-vortex air is dispersed into the middle latitudes within a month 26 sometimes a mass of the polar vortex breaks off before the end of the final warming period if large enough the piece can move into canada and the midwestern central southern and northeastern united states this diversion of the polar vortex can occur due to the displacement of the polar jet stream for example the significant northwestward direction of the polar jet stream in the western part of the united states during the winters of 2013–2014 and 2014-2015 this caused warm dry conditions in the west and cold snowy conditions in the east 27 occasionally the high-pressure air mass called the greenland block can cause the polar vortex to divert to the south rather than follow its normal path over the north atlantic 28 climate change edit meanders of the northern hemisphere s jet stream developing a b and finally detaching a drop of cold air c orange warmer masses of air pink jet stream a study in 2001 found that stratospheric circulation can have anomalous effects on weather regimes 29 in the same year researchers found a statistical correlation between weak polar vortex and outbreaks of severe cold in the northern hemisphere 30 31 in more recent years scientists identified interactions with arctic sea ice decline reduced snow cover evapotranspiration patterns nao anomalies or weather anomalies which are linked to the polar vortex and jet stream configuration 29 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 however because the specific observations are considered short-term observations starting c 13 years ago there is considerable uncertainty in the conclusions climatology observations require several decades to definitively distinguish natural variability from climate trends citation needed southern hemisphere ozone concentration february 22 2012 the general assumption is that reduced snow cover and sea ice reflect less sunlight and therefore evaporation and transpiration increases which in turn alters the pressure and temperature gradient of the polar vortex causing it to weaken or collapse this becomes apparent when the jet stream amplitude increases meanders over the northern hemisphere causing rossby waves to propagate farther to the south or north which in turn transports warmer air to the north pole and polar air into lower latitudes the jet stream amplitude increases with a weaker polar vortex hence increases the chance for weather systems to become blocked a recent blocking event emerged when a high-pressure over greenland steered hurricane sandy into the northern mid-atlantic states 38 ozone depletion edit the chemistry of the antarctic polar vortex has created severe ozone depletion the nitric acid in polar stratospheric clouds reacts with chlorofluorocarbons to form chlorine which catalyzes the photochemical destruction of ozone 39 chlorine concentrations build up during the polar winter and the consequent ozone destruction is greatest when the sunlight returns in spring 40 these clouds can only form at temperatures below about −80 °c −112 °f since there is greater air exchange between the arctic and the mid-latitudes ozone depletion at the north pole is much less severe than at the south 41 accordingly the seasonal reduction of ozone levels over the arctic is usually characterized as an ozone dent whereas the more severe ozone depletion over the antarctic is considered an ozone hole this said chemical ozone destruction in the 2011 arctic polar vortex attained for the first time a level clearly identifiable as an arctic ozone hole citation needed outside earth edit hubble view of the colossal polar cloud on mars other astronomical bodies are also known to have polar vortices including venus double vortex—that is two polar vortices at a pole 42 mars jupiter saturn and saturn s moon titan hot polar vortex edit saturn s south pole is the only known hot polar vortex in the solar system 43

powhatan native americans 9 in 1737 planter william byrd ii commissioned major william mayo to lay out the original town grid byrd named the city richmond after the english town of richmond near and

location for virginia s increasing westerly population as well as to isolate the capital from british attack 12 the latter motive proved to be in vain and in 1781 under the command of benedict arnold richmond was burned by british troops causing governor thomas jefferson to flee as the virginia militia led by sampson mathews defended the city 13 early united states edit richmond recovered quickly from the war and by 1782 was once again a thriving city 14 in 1786 the virginia statute for religious freedom drafted by thomas jefferson 1743-1826 was passed at the temporary capitol in richmond

richmond emerged as an important industrial center to facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed james river bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below an enterprising george washington helped design the james river and kanawha canal from westham east to richmond in the 18th century to bypass richmond s rapids on the upper james river with the intent of providing a water route across the appalachian mountains to the kanawha river flowing westward into the ohio then eventually to the mississippi river the legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag as a result of this and ample access to hydropower due to the falls richmond became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities in the country including iron works and flour mills the largest facilities of their kind in the south the resistance to the slave trade was growing by the mid-nineteenth century in one famous case in 1848 henry box brown made history by having himself nailed into a small box and shipped from richmond through baltimore s president street station northward on the philadelphia wilmington and baltimore railroad a well-used underground railroad route for escaping disguised slaves to abolitionists in philadelphia in the free state of pennsylvania escaping slavery 16 by 1850 richmond was connected by the richmond and

its national capital from its provisional home in montgomery alabama to richmond the city was located at the end of a long supply line which made it difficult to defend requiring the bulk of the army of northern virginia and arguably the confederacy s best troops and commanders 18 it became the main target of union armies especially in the campaigns of 1862 and 1864–65 in addition to virginia and confederate government offices and hospitals a railroad hub and one of the largest slave markets richmond had the largest iron foundry and arms factory during the war the tredegar iron works which

commanding union general-in-chief george b mcclellan threatened to take richmond in the peninsula campaign but ultimately failed three years later as march 1865 ended richmond became indefensible after nearby petersburg and several remaining rail supply lines to the south and southwest were broken on march 25 confederate general john b gordon s desperate attack on fort stedman east of petersburg failed on april 1 federal cavalry general philip sheridan assigned to interdict the southside railroad met brigades commanded by southern gen george pickett at the five forks junction

the mayor and a group of leading citizens who remained 21 the union troops eventually managed to stop the raging fires but about 25 of the city s buildings were destroyed 22 president abraham lincoln

davis was captured on may 10th near irwinville georgia and taken back to virginia where he was imprisoned for two years at fort monroe until freed on bail 24 postbellum edit richmond emerged a decade after the smoldering rubble of the civil war to resume its position as an economic powerhouse with iron front buildings and massive brick factories canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly gave way to railroads allowing richmond to become a major railroad crossroads eventually including the site of the world s first triple railroad crossing 25 tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a role boosted by the world s first cigarette-rolling machine invented by james albert bonsack of roanoke in 1880 81 contributing to richmond s resurgence was the first successful electrically powered trolley system in the united states the richmond union passenger railway designed by electric power pioneer frank j sprague the trolley system opened its first line in 1888 and electric streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the country 26 sprague s system used an overhead wire and trolley pole to collect current with electric motors on the car s trucks 27 in richmond

finally completed on monument avenue facing the opposite direction from the confederate generals on july 10 1996 37 a multimillion-dollar flood wall was completed in 1995 in order to protect low-lying

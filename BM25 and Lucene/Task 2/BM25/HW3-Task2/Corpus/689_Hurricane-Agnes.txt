yucatán peninsula western cuba florida panhandle georgia north carolina virginia maryland pennsylvania new york part of the 1972 atlantic hurricane season hurricane agnes was at the time the costliest hurricane to hit the united states in recorded history the second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the 1972 atlantic hurricane season agnes developed on june 14 from the interaction of a polar front and an upper trough over the yucatán peninsula initially forming as a tropical depression the storm headed slowly eastward and emerged into the western caribbean sea on june 15 once in the caribbean the depression began to strengthen and by the following day it became tropical storm agnes thereafter agnes slowly curved northward and passed just west of cuba on june 17 early on june 18 the storm intensified enough to be upgraded to hurricane agnes heading northward the hurricane eventually made landfall near panama city florida late on june 19 after moving inland agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered georgia the weakening trend halted as the storm crossed over georgia and into south carolina while over eastern north carolina agnes re-strengthened into a tropical storm on june 21 as a result of baroclinic activity early the following day the storm emerged into the atlantic ocean before re-curving northwestward and making landfall near new york city as a strong tropical storm agnes quickly became an extratropical cyclone on june 23 and tracked to the northwest of great britain before becoming absorbed by another cyclone on july 6 though it moved slowly across the yucatán peninsula damage in mexico is unknown although the storm bypassed the tip of cuba heavy rainfall occurred killing seven people in florida agnes caused a significant tornado outbreak with at least 26 confirmed twisters two of which were spawned in georgia the tornadoes and two initially unconfirmed tornadoes in florida alone resulted in over 4.5 million 1972 usd in damage and six fatalities at least 2,082 structures in florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed about 1,355 other dwellings experienced minor losses though agnes made landfall as a hurricane no hurricane-force winds were reported along the coast abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage especially between apalachicola and cedar key light to moderate rainfall was reported in florida though no significant flooding occurred in georgia damage was limited to two tornadoes which caused approximately 275,000 in losses minimal effects were also recorded in alabama connecticut delaware rhode island south carolina and tennessee though one fatality was reported in delaware the most significant effects by far occurred in pennsylvania mostly due to intense flooding the hurricane severely flooded the susquehanna river and the lackawanna river causing major damage to the wilkes-barre scranton metropolitan area in both pennsylvania and new jersey combined about 43,594 structures were either destroyed or significantly damaged in canada a mobile home was toppled killing two people overall agnes caused 128 fatalities and nearly 3 billion in damage 1 though more recently it is estimated that there were 2.1 billion in losses associated with the storm due to the significant effects the name agnes was retired in the spring of 1973 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale in early-mid june 1972 atmospheric conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis in the caribbean sea banded convection developed in the northwestern caribbean sea by june 11 though the system did not significantly organize after an upper trough moved east wind shear decreased causing lower atmospheric pressures observations in cozumel quintana roo mexico 2 it is estimated that a tropical depression developed by 1200 utc on june 14 while centered over the yucatán peninsula about 78 miles 126 km southeast of mérida yucatán 3 the depression tracked eastward and entered the western caribbean sea on june 15 2 operationally the national hurricane center did not initiate advisories on the depression until 1500 utc on june 15 4 early on june 16 at 0000 utc the depression strengthened into tropical storm agnes 3 however the depression was not operationally upgraded until sixteen hours later 5 after becoming a tropical storm on june 16 agnes slowly curved northward and approached the yucatán channel 3 late on june 17 it was noted that projected path indicated the possibly of landfall in western cuba 6 however the storm remained offshore though it closely brushed the western tip of cuba at 1200 utc on june 18 agnes intensified into a hurricane while in the southeastern gulf of mexico 3 prematurely the national hurricane center operationally upgraded agnes to a hurricane at 0200 utc on that day 7 upon becoming a hurricane agnes attained its maximum sustained winds of 85 mph 140 km h though it had not reached its minimum atmospheric pressure due to unfavorable conditions agnes leveled-off slightly in intensity and weakened to a minimal hurricane while approaching the gulf coast of the united states 2 shortly before 2200 utc on june 19 agnes made landfall near cape san blas florida with winds of 75 mph 120 km h 8 remnants of agnes over northeastern united states at 0000 utc on june 20 only a few hours after moving inland agnes weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the florida alabama georgia stateline agnes rapidly weakened to a tropical depression while over georgia the depression curved northeastward and eventually to the east-northeast after entering south carolina 2 though the storm had not dissipated the national hurricane center issued its final bulletin on agnes at 1600 utc on june 20 9 by early on june 21 a large extratropical trough spawned a low pressure area which resulted in baroclinic activity as a result agnes restrengthened into a tropical storm at 1800 utc on june 21 while centered over eastern north carolina 2 three hours later the national hurricane center noted decreasing atmospheric pressures and indicated that winds had reached gale force winds and once again upgraded agnes to a tropical storm 10 by early on june 22 agnes emerged into the northwestern atlantic ocean where it continued to re-intensify at 1200 utc agnes reached its minimum atmospheric pressure of 977 mbar 28.9 inhg as reported by a reconnaissance aircraft however maximum sustained winds were at only 70 mph 110 km h 2 3 late on june 22 agnes made its final landfall on long beach new york on long island with winds of 65 mph 100 km h 11 agnes began its long life as an extratropical cyclone once cold air invaded its circulation late on june 22 the system looped across south-central pennsylvania on june 23 and then looped across southern ontario on june 25 it spawned a tornado in maniwaki ontario early that day which killed two and injured 11 people the cyclone sped east-northeast reaching cape breton on june 27 before intensifying as it re-entered the north atlantic after moving as far north as the 61st parallel while crossing the 25th meridian west on the morning of june 29 agnes turned southeastward its central pressure bottomed out near 980 millibars 29 inhg towards 0000 utc on june 30 between july 1 and july 3 the long-lived system looped between ireland and iceland while weakening once more the system turned northeast strengthening one more time while accelerating across the hebrides on july 4 through 5 a stronger system moving in from the west finally absorbed agnes on july 6 while finally located to the southeast of iceland 12 preparations edit by 2200 utc on june 17 the national weather service issued gale warnings and a hurricane watch for the straits of florida and the florida keys from key west to dry tortugas 13 on the following day at 1600 utc another hurricane watch was put into effective from cedar key to pensacola in addition the gale warnings in the florida keys were extended to include areas from fort myers beach to clearwater 14 at 2200 utc on june 18 a hurricane warning became effective from st marks to panama city 15 the gale warnings which were in effect for the florida keys and fort myers beach to clearwater was discontinued at 1000 utc on june 19 16 it is likely that the hurricane warning was discontinued after the national hurricane center downgraded agnes to a tropical storm at 2200 utc on june 20 8 two hours later all gale warnings along the west coast of florida were discontinued 17 impact edit death tolls by area area deaths canada 2 cuba 7 florida 9 north carolina 2 virginia 13 delaware 1 maryland 19 new jersey

extensively with 2,226 and 5,842 structures experiencing major losses or were destroyed of the 128 fatalities caused by agnes 119 occurred in the united states all of the damage estimates associated with agnes were within the country agnes was at the time the costliest hurricane in the history of the united states though it has since been surpassed by numerous other storms florida edit upon landfall agnes produced abnormally high tides along much of the florida coastline the highest tides reported were at cedar key reaching 7 feet 2.1 m above normal sea levels the second largest waves were 6.4 feet 2.0 m recorded at apalachicola in contrast few observations of high tides along the east coast of florida exist the highest reported was 3 feet 0.91 m above average in jacksonville 2 in alligator point at least 16 homes were swept off their foundations six bridges connecting cedar key to the mainland areas of florida were submerged in addition a bridge from coquina key to st

have occurred though there were no specific observations in that vicinity 19 damage in key west florida from a tornado spawned by agnes though agnes made landfall as a hurricane no reports of hurricane-force winds exist however several locations observed tropical storm force winds the highest sustained winds and gusts were 52 and 69 mph 84 and 111 km h both recorded at the kennedy space center other reports of at least tropical storm force sustained winds were at 39 mph 63 km h in crestview and jacksonville 42 mph 68 km h in flamingo 43 mph 69 km h in key west and two observations of 40 mph 64 km h in panama city 2 throughout the state agnes spawned at least 15 tornadoes while several tornadoes were operationally unconfirmed initially referred to as a windstorm one of those twisters destroyed 50 mobile homes and a fishing camp in okeechobee as well as cause six fatalities another significant tornado occurred in cape canaveral which destroyed two homes and 30 trailers it also damaged 20 houses and the port canaveral coast guard station overall more than 100 people were left homeless and caused 23 injuries and over 500,000 in damage the costliest tornado was also spawned in brevard county and it destroyed 44 planes at the merritt island airport and an apartment building in addition several houses in a nearby subdivision were also damaged losses from this tornado are estimated at 3 million due to a combination of high tides rainfall winds and tornadoes 96 dwellings were destroyed while about 1,802 suffered damage to some degree the destruction of 177 mobile homes was reported and 374 others were significantly damaged furthermore 988 small businesses in the state were either destroyed or had major damage 20 eight counties in florida reported at

least 39 million in losses were reported 21 in addition nine fatalities were reported in florida 22 southeastern united states edit rainfall accumulations in association with hurricane agnes in the states immediately to the north of florida impact was relatively minor rainfall was generally light in georgia though peaking at 8.55 inches 217 mm in brunswick other locations that reported precipitations include 4.54 inches 115 mm in albany 3.95 inches 100 mm in savannah and 3.18 inches 81 mm in macon 2 during the tornado outbreak two of the tornadoes were spawned in georgia the tornado in pierce county caused 25,000 in damage and one injury 23 losses were more significant from the twister in coffee county reaching 250,000 24 one mobile home in georgia suffered significant damage though it is unknown if this was related to the tornadoes 20 though the damage from both tornadoes combined was about 275,000 23 24 the national hurricane center notes only 205,000 in losses 22 in alabama tides up to 1.3 feet 0.40 m above normal were reported in the mobile bay area though rainfall only reached 3.93 inches 100 mm and 1.08 inches 27 mm in dothan and mobile 19 precipitation from the storm in the state of alabama peaked at 7.67 inches 195 mm in headland damage in the state was minor though low-lying streets in the gulf shores were flooded 25 in some areas of south carolina the storm dropped as much as 9.5 inches 240 mm of rain in less than 36 hours as a result several rivers flooded along the pee dee river pastures small grains and soy bean crops near cheraw suffered major damage similar effects occurred along the congaree river near columbia though damage was lesser in greenville damage to basements streets and water systems occurred after the reedy river overflowed 26

recorded its all-time highest flow rate and stream heights 38 before the river crested the water came within feet of overtopping the dam as the dam s normal flood control devices seemed unable to cope engineers had placed charges to blow out a section of the dam to prevent a catastrophic failure pennsylvania edit in pennsylvania heavy rainfall was reported with much of the state experiencing more than 7 inches 180 mm of precipitation furthermore a large swath of rainfall exceeding 10 inches 250 mm was reported in the central part of the state overall the rains peaked at 19 inches 480 mm in the western portions of schuylkill county 19 as a result agnes is listed as the wettest tropical cyclone on record for the state of pennsylvania overall more than 100,000 people were forced to leave their homes due to flooding some buildings were under 13 feet 4.0 m of water in harrisburg 39 at the governor s mansion the first floor was submerged by flood waters hundreds were trapped in their homes in

sending flood waters into the city water poured into the first floor of an art museum in chadds ford township which threatened at least 2.5 million in n.c wyeth paintings though they were quickly moved to the upper floors along the allegheny river it was above flood stage in some low-lying areas during the height of the storm the river was rising at about 7 inches 180 mm per hour 39 in reading the schuylkill river reached a record flood of 31.5 feet hundreds of people were evacuated and over a hundred homes destroyed floods reached as far inland as 3rd street in the heart of the city 41

where they had been covering the flooding the victims were del vaughn of cbs news and sid brenner and louis clark of wcau in philadelphia and the pilot mike sedio the helicopter lost its rotor some three hundred feet above the capital city airport crashed and exploded on the runway 42 new york edit flood waters on the genesee river nearly top the spillway of the mount morris dam in letchworth state park olean elmira and corning as well as many other southern tier towns were severely flooded sections of the former erie railroad main line between hornell and binghamton were damaged flooding in the upper allegheny river basin was particularly exacerbated by the construction of the kinzua dam less than a decade prior several towns in cattaraugus county suffered extensive road and bridge damage that four decades later has yet to be repaired with the state and local governments opting to abandon creek and river crossings instead of reconstruct them however said dam construction allegedly succeeded in preventing further damage downstream in pennsylvania and much of the flood-prone areas in the allegheny reservoir region had already been cleared of residents in preparation for the dam s construction in elmira porches and garages were ripped loose the walnut st bridge was carried away maple ave to notre dame high school was underwater and on s main st. gerould s pharmacy at w hudson was engulfed by 10 feet 3 inches 3.12 m of water hornell s damage was minimal largely due to the protection of two dam systems installed after the devastating 1935 flood both the arkport and almond dams saved hornell from the level of damage found in neighboring communities three us army corp of engineers were killed in hornell when their helicopter came in contact with power lines over crosby creek the height of the floodwaters has been marked in the entrance to the corning museum of glass showing that much of the museum was under water to a height of about 1.6 m above the floor causing substantial damage to the collection and archives parts of corning were under more than 3 m of flood waters west virginia and ohio edit rainfall in west virginia was generally light though heavier in the eastern and northern panhandles of the state 19 precipitation peaked at 7.94 inches 202 mm in berkeley springs 108 houses were destroyed and 1,558 others suffered damage furthermore 118 mobile homes were destroyed and 91 were significantly affected 10 farm buildings reported major losses while 18 small businesses were either damaged or destroyed 20 in the state of west virginia no fatalities were reported and damage was slightly more than 7.7 million 22 although no reports of abnormally high winds or rainfall exists in ohio 2 the storm caused minor damage to about 302 dwellings and severely affected at least three houses in addition at least 100 mobile homes suffered major damage 20 northeasterly winds from the storm waves reaching a height of 15 feet 4.6 m along the shore of lake erie and also caused the water level to rise by 3.5 feet 1.1 m houses cars boats buildings ships and docks in the vicinity of lake erie were damaged 26 overall losses in ohio totaled to at least 4 million 22 26 elsewhere in the united states edit while approaching delaware agnes produced tides about 1.5 feet 0.46 m above normal at the indian river inlet high winds were also reported in the state and at the dover air force base a wind gust as high as 67 mph 108 km h was reported 2 rainfall was generally light peaking at 7.6 inches 190 mm in middletown 43 street flooding was reported and basements in low-lying area were flooded though damage in delaware was minimal 44 one fatality occurred in that state 2 in the washington d.c area moderate rainfall was reported with precipitation amounts peaking at 13.65 inches 347 mm at the washington dulles international airport 2 significant flooding occurred and it was described as the worst in at least 44 years in the georgetown section waterfront streets along the potomac river were submerged in as much as 7 feet 2.1 m of water 45 the rock creek also overflowed its banks which sent about 10 feet 3.0 m of water onto the rock creek parkway as a result at least 100 cars were abandoned and several motorists required rescuing by police 39 no national monuments were affected by flood waters 45 however about 350 dwellings in washington d.c suffered minor damage 20 at the white house reporters noted wet carpets in the press room of the basement floor 39 though the storm passed just west of some areas in new england minimal impact in that region of the united states in connecticut winds were well below tropical storm force although a wind gust of 46 mph 74 km h was reported in hartford rainfall in the state was light peaking at 1.62 inches 41 mm also recorded in hartford 2 along the coast of connecticut high tides and heavy rainfall flooded coastal roads and basements high tides occurred along the coastline of rhode island reaching 3.2 feet 0.98 m above normal in providence 2 in combination with rainfall and high tides some coastal roads were flooded strong winds felled trees and numerous limbs in massachusetts causing power outages and property damage in the western and central portions of the state one home in great barrington was struck by a tree a similar incident occurred in milford high winds in southern and eastern vermont knocked over trees and snapped off limbs which resulted in scattered power outages roads being blocked and minor property damage in mendon a tree fell on a house while two cars were damaged after being struck by limbs similar conditions occurred in new hampshire albeit effects were lesser 26 elsewhere edit as a precaution more than 8,000 people in western cuba including on isla de la juventud isle of pines were evacuated 46 in western cuba agnes dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 16.76 inches 426 mm on isla de la juventud at cape san antonio the westernmost point in cuba precipitation reached 15.32 inches 389 mm 2 due to high winds and flooding at least 97 houses were destroyed and another 270 were damaged in the pinar del río province the cities of guane and mantua were isolated by swollen rivers it was also reported that extensive crop damage occurred in low-lying areas 46 overall seven fatalities occurred in cuba though the damage toll is unknown 47 however some sources claim agnes caused 16 fatalities and reported 24 people missing 48 in canada hurricane agnes gave heavy rains and winds over southern ontario and southern quebec causing numerous floodings around lake erie and lake ontario in the town of maniwaki quebec the storm toppled a mobile home killing two people 49 aftermath edit following the storm then-president of the united states richard nixon declared 14 counties in florida as a disaster area including brevard county dixie county franklin county hendry county hillsborough county lee county levy county manatee county monroe county okeechobee county pasco county pinellas county sarasota county and wakulla county 50 in panama city florida where over 25,000 tourists evacuated effects were not significant as a result the city lost millions of dollars from tourism which led the officials of panama city to file a 100 million lawsuit against the national weather service officials in that city believed that the national weather service and other media outlets made exaggerated and erroneous forecasts and reports on the storm 51 20 of maryland s 24 counties were declared a disaster area following the storm then-president of the united states richard nixon declared the states of florida virginia maryland pennsylvania and new york as disaster areas agnes had a devastating impact on the already-bankrupt railroads in the northeastern united states as lines were washed out and shipments were delayed the erie lackawanna railway el estimated that damage between binghamton and salamanca new york amounted to 2 million el filed for chapter 77 bankruptcy the penn central railroad sustained nearly 20 million in damages the resulting cost of repairing the damage was one of the factors leading to the creation of the federally financed conrail citation needed the severe floods near lawrenceville pennsylvania were the catalyst for the construction of the tioga reservoir in 1973 the flooding in wilkes-barre pennsylvania and the adjacent town of kingston led to the construction of a levee system that in 2006 successfully prevented massive flooding and in the same year was deemed very safe and protective by the army corps of engineers the levee also protected the area from the remnants of tropical storm lee and hurricane irene in 2011 with the water cresting just barely below the height of the structure conversely the existing kinzua dam built against the wishes of the seneca nation of new york spared much of western pennsylvania from the worst flooding by filling the allegheny reservoir to capacity retirement edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names because of extensive damage and severe death tolls the name agnes was retired following this storm and will never again be used for another atlantic hurricane 52 because the tropical cyclone naming lists were changed in 1979 there was no replacement name selected

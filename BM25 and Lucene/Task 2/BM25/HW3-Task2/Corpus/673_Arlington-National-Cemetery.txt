house memorial drive the hemicycle and the arlington memorial bridge form the arlington national cemetery historic district listed on the national register of historic places in april 2014 2 3 like nearly all federal installations in arlington county it has a washington d.c mailing address in recent years the department of the army has made plans and taken actions to expand the cemetery onto public lands that the national park service nps controlled or that arlington county or the commonwealth of virginia owned as well as to restrict bicycle use within the cemetery these plans and actions have become controversial history edit custis lee mansion with union soldiers on lawn george washington parke custis grandson of martha washington acquired the land that now is arlington national cemetery in 1802 and began construction of arlington house the name is ultimately derived from the village of arlington gloucestershire england where custis family was originally from the estate passed to custis daughter mary anna who had married united states army officer robert e lee custis will gave a life inheritance to mary lee allowing her to live at and run arlington estate for the rest of her life but not enabling her to sell any portion of it 4 upon her death the arlington estate passed to her eldest son george washington custis lee 4 when virginia seceded from the union at the start of the american civil war robert e lee resigned his commission on april 20 1861 and took command of the armed forces of the commonwealth of virginia later becoming commander of the army of northern virginia 5 on may 7 troops of the virginia militia occupied arlington and arlington house 6 with confederate forces occupying arlington s high ground the capital of the union was left in an untenable military position 7 although unwilling to leave arlington house mary lee believed her estate would soon be recaptured by federal soldiers so she buried many of her family treasures on the

city of alexandria virginia of all troops not loyal to the united states 10 mcdowell occupied arlington without opposition on may 24 11 arlington house at the outbreak of the civil war most military personnel who died in battle near washington d.c. were buried at the united states soldiers cemetery in washington d.c. or alexandria cemetery in alexandria virginia but by late 1863 both were nearly full 12 on july 16 1862 congress passed legislation authorizing the u.s federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead and put the u.s army quartermaster general in charge of this program 12 in may 1864 union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the battle of the wilderness quartermaster general montgomery c meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery within weeks his staff reported that arlington estate was the most suitable property in the area 12 the property was high and free from floods which might unearth graves it had a view of the district of columbia and it was aesthetically pleasing it was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the confederate states of america and denying robert e lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration 13 the first military burial at arlington for william henry christman was made on may 13 1864 14 close to what is now the northeast gate in section 27 15 however meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until june 15 1864 16 arlington did not desegregate its burial practices until president harry s truman issued executive order 9981 on july 26 1948 17 the old guard transports the flag-draped casket of the second sergeant major of the army george w dunaway who was buried with full military honors at arlington national cemetery the government acquired arlington at a tax sale in 1864 for 26,800 equal to 410,000 today 18 mrs lee had not appeared in person but rather had sent an agent attempting to pay the 92.07 in property taxes equal to 1,400 today assessed on the estate in a timely manner 19 the government turned away her agent refusing to accept the tendered payment in 1874 custis lee heir under his grandfather s will passing the estate in trust to his mother sued the united states claiming ownership of arlington on december 9 1882 the u.s supreme court ruled 5–4 in lee s favor in united states v lee deciding that arlington had been confiscated without due process 19 20 after that decision congress returned the estate to him and on march 3 1883 custis lee sold it back to the government for 150,000 equal to 3,271,364 in 2017 at a signing ceremony with secretary of war robert todd lincoln 18 21 the land then became a military reservation 22 president herbert hoover conducted the first national memorial day ceremony in arlington national cemetery on may 30 1929 23 freedmen s village edit beginning in 1863 the federal government used the southern portion of the land now occupied by the cemetery as a settlement for freed slaves giving the name of freedmen s village to the land the government constructed rental houses that 1,100 to 3,000 freed slaves eventually occupied while farming 1,100 acres 450 ha of the estate and receiving schooling and occupational training during the civil war and after war ended 21 24 however after the land became part of a military reservation the government asked the villagers to leave when some remained john a commerford the superintendent of arlington national cemetery asked the army s quartermaster general in 1887 to close the village on the grounds that people living in the village had been taking trees at night from the cemetery for use as firewood 22 25 the quartermaster general and the secretary of war then approved commerford s request 22 the last of the village s residents departed after the 56th united states congress appropriated 75,000 in 1900 to settle the government s debts to them 22 recent expansion edit with limited space but large numbers of world war ii korean war vietnam war and other veterans dying and wanting to be buried at arlington the need for additional burial space at the cemetery became a pressing issue in 1991 cemetery superintendent john c metzler jr. implemented a 1.4 million plan to clear a former 13 acres 5.3 ha parking lot to create space for about 9,000 new grave sites 26 the cemetery received the authority to transfer 12 acres 4.9 ha of woodland from the nps-controlled arlington house in 1996 27 28 and 2001 29 30 37 acres 15 ha of land in 1999 from the dod that was the site of the navy annex building 31 32 8 acres 3.2 ha of land in 1999 from the department of the army that was part of fort myer 31 33 4 acres 1.6 ha of land from arlington county s southgate road right-of-way in 2004 34 and just under 10 acres 4.0 ha of land from fort myer in 2005 29 35 36 gravestones at arlington national cemetery are marked by u.s flags each memorial day in 2007 metzler implemented the millennium project a 35 million expansion plan to begin utilizing the arlington woodland fort myer and navy annex land the project also included converting 40 acres 16 ha of unused space and 4 acres 16,000 m2 of maintenance property on the cemetery grounds into burial space in 2006 and 2007 to allow an additional 26,000 graves and 5,000 inurnments the millennium project expanded the cemetery s physical boundaries for the first time since the 1960s and was the largest expansion of burial space at the site since the american civil war 35 several environmental and historical preservation groups criticized metzler s plans as did the nps and the manager of arlington house 35 36 37 on march 26 2013 the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act 2013 public law 113-6 appropriated to the dod 84 million to plan design and construct the millennium project 38 the legislation additionally appropriated to the dod 19 million to study plan and design a future expansion of the cemetery s burial space 38 navy annex property expansion controversy edit in 1998 a congressional proposal to expand the cemetery onto land that the navy annex and fort myer then occupied led to concerns that arlington county officials had not been properly consulted leading to the withdrawal of the proposal 39 however the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2000 public law 106-65 which was enacted into law during october 1999 subsequently required the secretary of defense to transfer to the secretary of the army administrative jurisdiction of the 36 acres 15 ha navy annex property the act required the secretary of defense to demolish the annex s buildings and prepare the property for use as part of the cemetery while requiring the secretary of the army to incorporate the annex property into the cemetery 32 in january 2013 the county manager of arlington county virginia and the executive director of the army national military cemeteries consisting of arlington national cemetery and the united states soldiers and airmen s home national cemetery 40 signed a memorandum of understanding mou between the arlington county board and the department of the army to expand the cemetery even further under the tentative plan arlington county would give up the easement for southgate road which lies between the navy annex property and the cemetery s 2012 boundary and obtain a narrow easement along the southwest border of the navy annex site for a new southgate road in exchange the department of defense would give the navy annex parking lot to the county the army would also transfer land west of south joyce street to columbia pike to arlington county additionally the commonwealth of virginia would convey to the cemetery roughly the northern half of the virginia department of transportation land bounded by south joyce street columbia pike and south washington boulevard the cloverleaf interchange between columbia pike and s washington blvd would be eliminated and the hairpin turn in columbia pike straightened to provide a safer more natural exit from s washington blvd onto columbia pike although exact acreages were not specified and the plan depended upon the commonwealth of virginia s cooperation the mou if implemented would have created a more contiguous plot of land for the cemetery 41 however in december 2016 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 public law 114-328 authorized the secretary of the army to expand the cemetery by acquiring from arlington county and the commonwealth of virginia by condemnation and other means properties near the cemetery that contain the southgate road south joyce street and washington boulevard right-of-ways including the washington boulvard-columbia pike interchange 42 the army then informed the arlington county government in june 2017 that the army would no longer pursue a land exchange with the county the army told the county that the army would use the entire navy annex site to expand the cemetery and would acquire for the cemetery about 5 acres 2.0 ha of public land that arlington county then owned the army would also acquire for the cemetery expansion about 7 acres 2.8 ha of land located between columbia pike and interstate 395 that the commonwealth of virginia then owned 43 arlington woods expansion controversy edit a portion of arlington woods on humphreys drive 2013 on february 22 1995 officials of the united states department of the interior and the united states department of the army signed an agreement to transfer from arlington house the robert e lee memorial to the army a part of arlington woods which was located in section 29 of the nps at arlington national cemetery between arlington house and fort myer 44 the property transfer which involved 12 acres 4.9 ha of nps land was intended to permit metzler to start expanding the cemetery beyond its existing boundaries 28 45 environmentalists expressed concerns that the agreement would result in the partial destruction of the 24 acres 9.7 ha remnant of an historically important stand of native trees 37 46 a historical marker near the woodland notes that while visiting arlington house in 1825 gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette had warned mary lee fitzhugh custis the wife of george washington parke custis cherish these forest trees around your mansion recollect how much easier it is to cut a tree than to make one grow the marker further notes that the virginia native plant society had recognized the woodland as being one of the best examples of old growth terraced gravel forest remaining in virginia 47 on september 23 1996 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1997 public law 104-201 authorized the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army all of the land in section 29 that was within an arlington national cemetery interment zone and some of the land in the section that was within a robert e lee memorial preservation zone 27 28 on march 5 1998 the nps which is a component of the department of the interior informed the national capital planning commission that it wanted to transfer only 4 acres 1.6 ha to the cemetery rather than the 12 acres 4.9 ha that the 1995 agreement had described in response metzler stated i was surprised but we will continue to work with the department of interior and see what happens 28 on july 12 1999 the nps issued a federal register notice that announced the availability of an environmental assessment ea for the transfer 45 48 the ea stated that the interment zone contained the oldest and largest tract of climax eastern hardwood forest in arlington county this forest was the same type that once covered the arlington estate and had regenerated from trees that were present historically a forestry study determined that a representative tree was 258 years old the interment zone was also determined to contain significant archeological and cultural landscape resources in addition to those in the preservation zone 48 the ea described four alternative courses of action 48 in contrast to the nps s march 1998 statement to the national capital planning commission the 1999 ea stated that the preferred alternative alternative 1 would transfer to the cemetery approximately 9.6 acres 3.9 ha comprising most of the interment zone and the northern tip of the preservation zone 48 another alternative alternative 3 would transfer to the cemetery the 12 acres 4.9 ha interment zone while keeping the 12.5 acres 5.1 ha preservation zone under nps jurisdiction 48 the ea concluded public law 104-201 directed the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army jurisdiction over the interment zone which is the plan in alternative 3 adoption of any of the other alternatives would require legislative action to amend the existing law 48 map showing the millennium project s expansion of arlington national cemetery into arlington woods and fort myer on december 28 2001 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2002 public law 107-107 repealed the obsolete part of public law 104-201 that had authorized the transfer of portions of section 29 to the secretary of the army 30 the new legislation required the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army within 30 days the approximately 12 acres 4.9 ha interment zone 30 the transfer therefore involved the entire 12 acres 4.9 ha of nps land that the 1995 agreement and alternative 3 in the 1999 ea had described the 2001 legislation required the secretary of the army to use the interment zone for in-ground burial sites and columbarium 30 in addition the legislation required the secretary of the interior to manage the remainder of section 29 in perpetuity to provide a natural setting and visual buffer for arlington house the robert e lee memorial 30 on december 12 2012 the united states army corps of engineers asked for comments on a draft ea that described a further expansion of arlington national cemetery as part of the millennium project 49 50 51 the 2012 draft ea was intended to implement conversion into burial space of the 17 acres 6.9 ha of ft myer grounds as well as 10 acres 4.0 ha of section 29 woodland the draft ea described seven alternatives the preferred alternative alternative e called for the removal of about one-half of the 1,700 trees with a diameter of 6 inches 15 cm or greater on the site about 640 of the trees were within a 135-year-old portion of arlington woods 52 the draft ea concluded based on the evaluation of environmental impacts..... no significant impacts would be expected from the proposed action therefore an environmental impact statement will not be prepared and a finding of no significant impact will be prepared and signed 52 on march 12 2013 the corps of engineers released a revised ea for the millennium project 53 54 the revised ea contained copies of a number of public comments on the draft ea that had criticized the project and parts of the ea while proposing alternative locations for new military burials near the cemetery and elsewhere 55 however the department of forestry of the commonwealth of virginia found that based on information in the draft ea the project would not have a significant adverse impact on the commonwealth s forest resources 56 the revised ea did not change the preferred alternative alternative e or the army s plans to prepare and sign the finding of no significant impact fonsi that the draft ea had described 57 on june 5 2013 after reviewing 100 public comments that it had received on the revised ea the corps of engineers released a final ea and a signed fonsi for the millennium project 58 59 the final ea and the fonsi retained alternative e as the preferred alternative 58 the final ea stated that of the 905 trees to be removed 771 trees were healthy native trees that had diameters between 6 and 41 inches 60 61 the project would remove approximately 211 trees from a less than 2.63 acres 1.06 ha area containing a portion of a 145-year-old forest that stood within the property boundaries of a historic district that a national register of historic places nomination form for arlington house had described in 1966 60 62 about 491 trees would be removed from an area of trees that was approximately 105 years old 60 approximately 203 trees with ages of 50 to 145 years would be removed from a former picnic area 60 at a public hearing on

announced his intention to retire on july 2 2010 admitted some mistakes had been made but denied allegations of widespread or serious mismanagement 64 the investigation also found that cemetery employees were burdened in their day-to-day work by dysfunctional management lack of established policy and procedures and an overall unhealthy organizational climate 65 66 both metzler and higgenbotham retired soon after the investigation commenced 67 in march 2011 as a result of the problems discovered kathryn condon the recently appointed executive director of the army national military cemeteries announced that the cemetery s staff had been increased from 102 to 159 she added that the cemetery was also acquiring additional equipment because they didn t have the proper equipment to do the job really to the standard they needed to do 68 the mismanagement controversy included a limitation on mass media access to funerals which also proved controversial until 2005 the cemetery s administration gave free access with the family s permission to the press to cover funerals at the cemetery according to the washington post in 2008 the cemetery gradually imposed increasing restrictions on media coverage of funerals beginning about 2005 69 management turnover edit after the cemetery s management controversy began to end the army appointed patrick k hallinan

army could find a successor 72 wreaths across america edit wreaths laid at arlington national cemetery december 2013 beginning in 1992 the morrill worcester wreath company in harrington maine had a surplus at the end of the holiday season recalling a boyhood trip to the cemetery worcester donated to the cemetery 5,000 wreaths to honor the cemetery s dead with the help of volunteers and a local trucking company after thirteen years of similar donations in 2005 a photo of snowy gravestones covered with wreaths at the cemetery received widespread circulation on the internet thousands of people called worcester wanting to replicate the wreath-laying service at their own veteran cemeteries 73 in 2006 over 150 different locations simultaneously held ceremonies with arlington s additionally the

cemetery for the first time 73 in 2016 this number increased to 1.2 million wreaths being placed at more than 1,230 cemeteries across the nation 76 conflict of interest charges have been made against wreaths across america because this charity has an exclusive for-profit supplier worcestor wreath company also run by the morrill family in the same town the charity s purchases of wreaths from this company account for most of the company s revenue and profits in late 2015 the wall street journal reported serious conflicts of interest with potential malfeasance in governance and contracting 77 in

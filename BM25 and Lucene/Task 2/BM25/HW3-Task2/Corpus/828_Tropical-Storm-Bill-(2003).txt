affected the gulf coast of the united states in the summer of 2003 the second storm of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season bill developed from a tropical wave on june 29 to the north of the yucatán peninsula it slowly organized as it moved northward and reached a peak of 60 miles per hour 97 km h shortly before making landfall in south-central louisiana bill quickly weakened over land and as it accelerated to the northeast moisture from the storm combined with cold air from an approaching cold front produced an outbreak of 34 tornadoes bill became extratropical on july 2 and was absorbed by the cold front later that day upon making landfall on louisiana the storm produced a moderate storm surge causing tidal flooding in a city in the northeastern portion of the state the surge breached a levee which flooded many homes in the town moderate winds combined with wet soil knocked down trees which then hit a few houses and power lines and left hundreds of thousands without electric power two people drowned from rough surf in florida further inland tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage throughout its path tropical storm bill caused around 50 million in damage 2003 usd and four deaths meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave developed scattered convection in the central caribbean sea on june 24 while interacting with an upper-level low it moved slowly northwestward 1 and remained disorganized due to strong upper level wind shear 2 late on june 27 the convection became slightly better organized around a broad low pressure area though land interaction prevented further development as it moved towards the yucatán peninsula 3 the area of low pressure became better defined over the central yucatán peninsula and after the system turned to the northwest convection quickly organized while located over the warm waters of the gulf of mexico on june 29 following the development of a closed circulation the system organized into tropical depression three while located about 40 miles 64 km north of progreso yucatán 4 radar image of tropical storm bill s landfall in louisiana the depression quickly strengthened to become tropical storm bill later on june 29 operationally the national hurricane center did not begin issuing advisories until it attained tropical storm status 4 initially the system resembled a subtropical cyclone with the strongest winds and deep convection located far from the center though it was classified tropical due to its tropical origins 5 the storm steadily intensified as wind shear decreased 4 and early forecasts from the national hurricane center mentioned the possibility of bill intensifying to hurricane status if the low level circulation organized beneath the area of deepest convection bill turned to the north-northwest and later to the north as it moved around the periphery of a ridge of high pressure 6 on june 30 tropical storm bill reached a peak intensity of 60 miles per hour 97 km h one hour before making landfall in southwestern terrebonne parish louisiana it moved onshore at peak intensity and quickly weakened to a depression over land as it accelerated to the northeast bill remained a tropical cyclone as it moved through the southeast united states 4 until it became attached to an approaching cold front on july 2 near the tennessee–virginia border 7 the remnant extratropical storm was absorbed by the cold front on july 3 near central virginia 4 while the remnant low pressure area continued northeastward until reaching the atlantic ocean later on july 3 8 preparations edit shortly after the storm formed the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm watch from the southern end of galveston island to morgan city louisiana as a more northward motion occurred the watch was canceled and replaced with a tropical storm warning from high island texas to pascagoula mississippi shortly before the storm made landfall the warning was discontinued between high island and cameron louisiana the national hurricane center briefly issued a hurricane watch from intracoastal city to morgan city but it was discontinued when tropical storm bill failed to strengthen 4 prior the storm making landfall local national weather service offices issued flash flood watches and a tornado watch for large portions of the gulf coast 9 the threat of tropical storm bill caused 41 oil platforms and 11 oil rigs to evacuate this resulted in a loss of production of over 71 thousand barrels 11,300 m3 of oil and 610 million cubic feet 17,000,000 m3 of gas 10 the american red cross mobilized workers and brought food water and other supplies to louisiana prior to the

damage estimates totaled to over 50 million 2003 usd 65.1 million 2017 usd primarily as a result of flooding or tornadic damage throughout its path bill spawned 34 tornadoes ranking it fourteenth in the list of north atlantic hurricanes generating the most tornadoes 13 the tornado outbreak was caused by wind shear moist air from the storm and cool air from an approaching cold front 14 in spite of the large numbers of tornadoes most were weak and short-lived 15 prior to forming the storm produced rainfall along coastal areas of mexico along the bay of campeche peaking at nearly 4 inches 100 mm in yucatán and over 3 inches 76 mm in campeche 16 western gulf coast edit rainfall totals from tropical storm bill the outer bands of bill dropped light rain across southeastern texas peaking at 1.07

history of the united states navy origins edit it follows then as certain as that night succeeds the day that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing definitive and with it everything honorable and glorious — george washington 17 the navy was rooted in the colonial seafaring tradition which produced a large community of sailors captains and shipbuilders 18 in the early stages of the american revolutionary war massachusetts had its own massachusetts naval militia the rational for establishing a national navy was debated in the second continental congress supporters argued that a navy would protect shipping defend the coast and make it easier to seek out support from foreign countries detractors countered that challenging the british royal navy then the world s preeminent naval power was a foolish undertaking commander in chief george washington resolved the debate when he commissioned the ocean-going schooner uss hannah to interdict british merchant ships and reported the captures to the congress on 13 october 1775 the continental congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to be armed for a cruise against british merchant ships this resolution created the continental navy and is considered the first establishment of the u.s navy 19 the continental navy achieved mixed results it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many british merchant vessels but it lost twenty-four of its vessels 20 and at one point was reduced to two in active service 21 in august 1785 after the revolutionary war had drawn to a close congress had sold alliance the last ship remaining in the continental navy due to a lack of funds to maintain the ship or support a navy 22 23 in 1972 the chief of naval operations admiral elmo zumwalt authorized the navy to

against the pirates their depredations far outstripped its abilities and congress passed the naval act of 1794 that established a permanent standing navy on 27 march 1794 25 the naval act ordered the construction and manning of six frigates and by october 1797 20 the first three were brought into service uss united states uss constellation and uss constitution due to his strong posture on having a

the first barbary war the u.s navy defended u.s ships from the barbary pirates blockaded the barbary ports and executed attacks against the barbary fleets the u.s navy saw substantial action in the war of 1812 where it was victorious in eleven single-ship duels with the royal navy it drove all significant british forces off lake erie and lake champlain and prevented them from becoming british-controlled zones the result was a major defeat for the british invasion of new york state and the defeat of the military threat from the native american allies of the british despite this the u.s navy was unable to prevent the british from blockading its ports and landing troops 28 after the war the u.s navy again focused its attention on protecting american shipping assets sending squadrons to the caribbean the mediterranean where it participated in the second barbary war that ended piracy in the region south america africa and the pacific 20 from 1819 to the outbreak of the

california with large scale land operations coordinated with the local militia organized in the california battalion the navy conducted the u.s military s first large-scale amphibious joint operation by successfully landing 12,000 army troops with their equipment in one day at veracruz mexico when larger guns were needed to bombard veracruz navy volunteers landed large guns and manned them in the successful bombardment and capture of the city this successful landing and capture of veracruz opened the way for the capture of mexico city and the end of the war 28 the u.s navy established itself as a player in united states foreign policy through the actions of commodore matthew perry in japan which resulted in the convention of kanagawa in 1854 citation needed naval power played a significant role during the american civil war in which the union had a distinct advantage over the confederacy on the seas 28 a union blockade on all major ports shut down exports and the coastal trade but blockade runners mostly owned and operated by british companies provided a thin lifeline the brown-water navy s control of the river systems made internal travel difficult for confederates

served as the sixth battle squadron of the british grand fleet its presence allowed the british to decommission some older ships and reuse the crews on smaller vessels destroyers and u.s naval air

favored concentrated groups of battleships as their main offensive naval weapons 36 the development of the aircraft carrier and its devastating utilization by the japanese against the u.s at pearl harbor however shifted u.s thinking the pearl harbor attack destroyed or took out of action a significant number of u.s navy battleships this placed much of the burden of retaliating against the

it is the principal means through which the u.s maintains international global order namely by safeguarding global trade and protecting allied nations 41 in 2007 the u.s navy joined with the u.s marine corps and u.s coast guard to adopt a new maritime strategy called a cooperative strategy for 21st century seapower that raises the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war the strategy was presented by the chief of naval operations the commandant of the marine corps and commandant of the coast guard at the international sea power symposium in newport ri on 17 october 2007 42 the strategy recognized the economic links of the global system and how any disruption due to regional crises—man-made or natural—can adversely impact the u.s economy and

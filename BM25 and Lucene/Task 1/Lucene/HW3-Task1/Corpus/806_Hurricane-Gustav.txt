meteorological history edit main article meteorological history of hurricane gustav map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale gustav formed out of a tropical wave that had previously produced t-rain and squalls in the lesser antilles it developed well-defined curved bands and briefly exhibited an upper-level eye feature the nhc designated it tropical depression seven and dispatched a hurricane hunter aircraft to investigate the system 8 at the time the system had a well-defined outflow in all but the southeast and southwest quadrant 8 9 and data from the hurricane-hunter aircraft confirmed that the tropical depression had strengthened into a tropical storm which was soon designated tropical storm gustav 10 a brief period of disorganization 11 proved to be temporary as a well-defined eye wall formed that same night 12 in the early hours of august 26 as the storm approached haiti s southwestern peninsula 13 another hurricane hunter aircraft confirmed what forecasters already suspected—that gustav had strengthened into a hurricane with winds topping 90 mph 150 km h 14 before reaching haiti its satellite presentation continued to intensify a central dense overcast became more prominent 15 and the minimum central pressure fell 16 hurricane gustav making landfall in haiti on august 25 hurricane gustav

and it lost a little strength 19 although downgraded to a tropical storm it still had a pronounced eye in its mid and upper-level structures its outflow improved throughout the night of august 26 20 and the system was not very disrupted when it moved back over water into the gulf of gonâve 21 however the storm s movement slowed and continued interaction with nearby haiti combined with the incursion of mid-level dry air from the northeast resulted in further weakening during the day on august 27 22 23 the storm began a west-southwesterly movement that brought it closer to jamaica on the morning of august 28 it was found that overnight gustav had either reformed farther to the south or had moved farther to the south than previously thought the storm was also found to have

appears to be an allusion to el nuevo herald which broke the news of jaled s arrival in miami what a patriot what a democrat what a brilliant example wrote castro this way the world is informed about

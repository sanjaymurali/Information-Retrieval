river was used again by the british to defeat the french siege of quebec under the chevalier de lévis in 1760 because of the virtually impassable lachine rapids the saint lawrence was once continuously navigable only as far as montreal opened in 1825 the lachine canal was the first to allow ships to pass the rapids an extensive system of canals and locks known as the saint lawrence

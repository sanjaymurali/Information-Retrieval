jerusalem and the dead sea mean sea level msl often shortened to sea level is an average level of the surface of one or more of earth s oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured msl is a type of vertical datum – a standardised geodetic reference point – that is used for example as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation or in aviation as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured to calibrate altitude and consequently aircraft flight levels a common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location 1 sea levels can be affected by many factors and are known to have varied greatly over geological time scales the careful measurement of variations in msl can offer insights into ongoing climate change and sea level rise has been widely quoted as evidence of ongoing global warming 2 the term above sea level generally refers to above mean sea level amsl measurement edit sea level measurements from 23 long tide gauge records in geologically stable environments show a rise of around 200 millimetres 7.9 in during the 20th century 2 mm year precise determination of a mean sea level is difficult to achieve because of the many factors that affect sea level 3 sea level varies quite a lot on several scales of time and space this is because the sea is in constant motion affected by the tides wind atmospheric pressure local gravitational differences temperature salinity and so forth the easiest way this may be calculated is by selecting a location and calculating the mean sea level at that point and use it as a datum for example a period of 19 years of hourly level observations may be averaged and used to determine the mean sea level at some measurement point to an operator of a tide gauge msl means the still water level —the level of the sea with motions such as wind waves averaged out—averaged over a period of time such that changes in sea level e.g. due to the tides also get averaged out one measures the values of msl in respect to the land hence a change in msl can result from a real change in sea level or from a change in the height of the land on which the tide gauge operates in the uk the ordnance datum the 0 metres height on uk maps is the mean sea level measured at newlyn in cornwall between 1915 and 1921 prior to 1921 the datum was msl at the victoria dock liverpool in hong kong mpd is a surveying term meaning metres above principal datum and refers to height of 1.230m below the average sea level in france the marégraphe in marseilles measures continuously the sea level since 1883 and offers the longest collapsed data about the sea level it is used for a part of continental europe and main part of africa as official sea level elsewhere in europe vertical elevation references european vertical reference system are made to the amsterdam peil elevation which dates back to the 1690s satellite altimeters have been making precise measurements of sea level 4 since the launch of topex poseidon in 1992 a joint mission of nasa and cnes topex poseidon was followed by jason-1 in 2001 and the ocean surface topography mission on the jason-2 satellite in 2008 height above mean sea level edit main article elevation height above mean sea level amsl is the elevation on the ground or altitude in the air of an object relative to the average sea level datum it is also used in aviation where some heights are recorded and reported with respect to mean sea level msl contrast with flight level and in the atmospheric sciences and land surveying an alternative is to base height measurements on an ellipsoid of the entire earth which is what systems such as gps do in aviation the ellipsoid known as world geodetic system 84 is increasingly used to define heights however differences up to 100 metres 328 feet exist between this ellipsoid height and mean tidal height the alternative is to use a geoid-based vertical datum such as navd88 when referring to geographic features such as mountains on a topographic map variations in elevation are shown by contour lines the elevation of a mountain denotes the highest point or summit and is typically illustrated as a small circle on a topographic map with the amsl height shown in metres feet or both in the rare case that a location is below sea level the elevation amsl is negative for one such case see amsterdam airport schiphol difficulties in use edit ocean reference ellipsoid local plumb line continent geoid to extend this definition far from the sea means comparing the local height of the mean sea surface with a level reference surface or geodetic datum called the geoid in a state of rest or absence of external forces the mean sea level would coincide with this geoid surface being an equipotential surface of the earth s gravitational field in reality due to currents air pressure variations temperature and salinity variations etc. this does not occur not even as a long-term average the location-dependent but persistent in time separation between mean sea level and the geoid is referred to as stationary ocean surface topography it varies globally in a range of ± 2 m historically adjustments were made to sea-level measurements to take into account the effects of the 235 lunar month metonic cycle and the 223-month

changing relationships between sea level and dry land when the term relative is used it means change relative to a fixed point in the sediment pile the term eustatic refers to global changes in sea level relative to a fixed point such as the centre of the earth for example as a result of melting ice-caps the term steric refers to global changes in sea level due to thermal expansion and salinity variations the term isostatic refers to changes in the level of the land relative to a fixed point in the earth possibly due to thermal buoyancy or tectonic effects it implies no change in the volume of water in the oceans the melting of glaciers at the end of ice ages is one example of eustatic sea level rise the subsidence of land due to the withdrawal of groundwater is an isostatic cause of relative sea level rise paleoclimatologists can track sea level by examining the rocks deposited along coasts that are very tectonically stable like the east coast of north america areas like volcanic islands are experiencing relative sea level rise as a result of isostatic cooling of the rock which causes the land to sink on other planets that lack a liquid ocean planetologists can calculate a mean altitude by averaging the heights of all points on the surface this altitude sometimes referred to as a sea level serves equivalently as a reference for the height of planetary features change edit not to be confused with past sea level current sea-level rise future sea level or sea level rise local and eustatic edit water cycles between ocean atmosphere and glaciers local mean sea level lmsl is defined as the height of the sea with respect to a land benchmark averaged over a period of time such as a month or a year long enough that fluctuations caused by waves and tides are smoothed out one must adjust perceived changes in lmsl to account for vertical movements of the land which can be of the same order mm yr as sea level changes some land movements occur because of isostatic adjustment of the mantle to the melting of ice sheets at the end of the last ice age the weight of the ice sheet depresses the underlying land and when the ice melts away the land slowly rebounds changes in ground-based ice volume also affect local and regional sea levels by the readjustment of the geoid and true polar wander atmospheric pressure ocean currents and local ocean temperature changes can affect lmsl as well eustatic change as opposed to local change results in an alteration to the global sea levels due to changes in either the volume of water in the world s oceans or net changes in the volume of the ocean basins 6 short term and periodic changes edit melting glaciers can cause a change in sea level there are many factors which can produce short-term a few minutes to 14 months changes in sea level two major mechanisms are causing sea level to rise first shrinking land ice such as mountain glaciers and polar ice sheets is releasing water into the oceans second as

has been rising at an average rate of about 1.8 mm 0.1 in per year 8 most of this rise can be attributed to the increase in temperature of the sea and the resulting slight thermal expansion of the upper 500 metres 1,640 feet of sea water additional contributions as much as one-quarter of the total come from water sources on land such as melting snow and glaciers and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human needs 9 aviation edit main article altitude in aviation pilots can estimate height above sea level with an altimeter set to a defined barometric pressure generally the pressure used to set the altimeter is the barometric pressure that would exist at msl in the region being flown over this pressure is referred to as either qnh or altimeter and is transmitted to the pilot by radio from air traffic control atc or an automatic terminal information service atis since the terrain elevation is also referenced to msl the pilot can estimate height above ground by subtracting the terrain altitude from the altimeter reading aviation charts are divided into boxes and the maximum terrain altitude from msl in each box is clearly indicated once above the transition altitude the altimeter is set to the international standard atmosphere isa pressure at msl which is 1013.25 hpa or 29.92 inhg 10

body-temperature thermal light this infrared space telescope image has false color blue green and red corresponding to 3.4 4.6 and 12 µm wavelengths respectively infrared radiation or simply infrared or ir is electromagnetic radiation emr with longer wavelengths than those of visible light and is therefore invisible although it is sometimes loosely called infrared light it extends from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers frequency 430 thz to 1 mm 300 ghz 1 although people can see infrared up to at least 1050 nm in experiments 2 3 4 5 most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared like all emr ir carries radiant energy and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle the photon infrared was discovered in 1800 by astronomer sir william herschel who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light by means of its effect on a thermometer 6 slightly more than half of the total energy from the sun was eventually found to arrive on earth in the form of infrared the balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has a critical effect on earth s climate infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational movements it excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range 7 infrared radiation is used in industrial scientific and medical applications night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds detect objects such as planets and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe 8 infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems to observe changing blood flow in the skin and to detect overheating of electrical apparatus thermal-infrared imaging is used extensively for military and civilian purposes military applications include target acquisition surveillance night vision homing and tracking humans at normal body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10 μm micrometers non-military uses include thermal efficiency analysis environmental monitoring industrial facility inspections remote

infrared edit sunlight at an effective temperature of 5,780 kelvins is composed of near thermal-spectrum radiation that is slightly more than half infrared at zenith sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per square meter at sea level of this energy 527 watts is infrared radiation 445 watts is visible light and 32 watts is ultraviolet radiation 10 nearly all the infrared radiation in sunlight is near infrared shorter than 4 micrometers on the surface of earth at far lower temperatures than the surface of the sun almost all thermal radiation consists of infrared in mid-infrared region much longer than in sunlight of these natural thermal radiation processes only lightning and natural fires are hot enough to produce much visible energy and fires produce far more infrared than visible-light energy regions within the infrared edit in general objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of wavelengths but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of interest because sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific bandwidth thermal infrared radiation also has a maximum emission wavelength which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of object in accordance with wien s displacement law therefore the infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections commonly used sub-division scheme edit a commonly used sub-division scheme is

in long-wavelength infrared nir and swir is sometimes called reflected infrared whereas mwir and lwir is sometimes referred to as thermal infrared due to the nature of the blackbody radiation curves typical hot objects such as exhaust pipes often appear brighter in the mw compared to the same object viewed in the lw cie division scheme edit the international commission on illumination cie recommended the division of infrared radiation into the following three bands 14 abbreviation wavelength frequency ir-a 700 nm – 1400 nm 0.7 µm – 1.4 µm 215 thz – 430 thz ir-b 1400 nm – 3000 nm 1.4 µm

are used for observation of different temperature ranges and hence different environments in space the most common photometric system used in astronomy allocates capital letters to different spectral regions according to filters used i j h and k cover the near-infrared wavelengths l m n and q refer to the mid-infrared region these letters are commonly understood in reference to atmospheric windows and appear for instance in the titles of many papers sensor response division scheme edit plot of atmospheric transmittance in part of the infrared region a third scheme divides up the band based on the response of various detectors 17 near-infrared from 0.7 to 1.0 µm from the approximate end of the response of the human eye to that of silicon short-wave infrared 1.0 to 3 µm from the cut-off of silicon to that of the mwir atmospheric window ingaas covers to about 1.8 µm the less sensitive lead salts cover this region mid-wave infrared 3 to 5 µm defined by the atmospheric window and covered by indium antimonide insb and hgcdte and partially by lead selenide pbse long-wave infrared 8 to 12 or 7 to 14 µm this is the atmospheric window covered by hgcdte and microbolometers very-long wave infrared vlwir 12 to about 30 µm covered by doped silicon near-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the human eye mid and far-infrared are progressively further from the visible spectrum other definitions follow different physical mechanisms emission peaks vs bands water absorption and the newest follow technical reasons the common silicon detectors are sensitive to about 1,050 nm while ingaas s sensitivity starts around 950 nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600 nm depending on the specific configuration no international standards for these specifications are currently available the onset of infrared is defined according to different standards at various values typically between 700 nm and 800 nm but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined the human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700 nm wavelength so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources however particularly intense near-ir light e.g. from ir lasers ir led sources or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels can be detected up to approximately 780 nm and will be perceived as red light intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050 nm can be seen as a dull red glow causing some difficulty in near-ir illumination of scenes in the dark usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination leaves are particularly bright in the near ir and if all visible light leaks from around an ir-filter are blocked and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque ir-passing photographic filter it is possible to see the wood effect that consists of ir-glowing foliage 18 telecommunication bands in the infrared edit in optical communications the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources transmitting absorbing materials fibers and detectors 19 band descriptor wavelength range o band original 1260–1360 nm e band extended 1360–1460 nm s band short wavelength 1460–1530 nm c band conventional 1530–1565 nm l band long wavelength 1565–1625 nm u band ultralong wavelength 1625–1675 nm the c-band is the dominant band for long-distance telecommunication networks the s and l bands are based on less well established technology and are not as widely deployed heat edit main article thermal radiation materials with higher emissivity appear to be hotter in this thermal image the ceramic cylinder appears to be hotter than its cubic container made of silicon carbide while in fact they have the same temperature infrared radiation is popularly known as heat radiation citation needed but light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them infrared light from the sun accounts for 49 20 of the heating of earth with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated at longer wavelengths visible light or ultraviolet-emitting lasers can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation objects at room temperature will emit radiation concentrated mostly in the 8 to 25 µm band but this is not distinct from the emission of visible light by incandescent objects and ultraviolet by even hotter objects see black body and wien s displacement law 21 heat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared extending into visible ultraviolet and even x-ray regions e.g the solar corona thus the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical comparatively low temperatures often found near the surface of planet earth the concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects this is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body to further explain two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity for example for any pre-set emissivity value objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler for that reason incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results

the scene at infrared wavelengths invisible to the human eye despite a dark back-lit scene active-infrared night vision delivers identifying details as seen on the display monitor infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see 22 night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light 22 infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source 22 the use of infrared light and night vision devices should not be confused with thermal imaging which creates images based on differences in surface temperature by detecting infrared radiation heat that emanates from objects and their surrounding environment 23 thermography edit thermography helped to determine the temperature profile of the space shuttle thermal protection system during re-entry main article thermography infrared radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of objects if the emissivity is known this is termed thermography or in the case of very hot objects in the nir or visible it is termed pyrometry thermography thermal imaging is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production costs thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum roughly 900–14,000 nanometers or 0.9–14 μm and produce images of that radiation since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures according to the black body radiation law thermography makes it possible to see one s environment with or without visible illumination the amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature hence the name hyperspectral imaging edit main article hyperspectral imaging hyperspectral thermal infrared emission measurement an outdoor scan in winter conditions ambient temperature −15 °c image produced with a specim lwir hyperspectral imager relative radiance spectra from various targets in the image are shown with arrows the infrared spectra of the different objects such as the watch clasp have clearly distinctive characteristics the contrast level indicates the temperature of the object 24 infrared light from the led of a remote control as recorded by a digital camera a hyperspectral image is a picture containing continuous spectrum through a wide spectral range at each pixel hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance in the field of applied spectroscopy particularly with nir swir mwir and lwir spectral regions typical applications include biological mineralogical defence and industrial measurements thermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a thermographic camera with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full lwir spectrum consequently chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the sun or the moon such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements outdoor surveillance and uav applications 25 other imaging edit in infrared photography infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum digital cameras often use infrared blockers cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can see intense near-infrared appearing as a bright purple-white color this is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near ir-bright areas such as near a lamp where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image there is also a technique called t-ray imaging which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques recently t-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy reflected light photograph in various infrared spectra to illustrate the appearance as the wavelength of light changes tracking edit main article infrared homing infrared tracking also known as infrared homing refers to a passive missile guidance system which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as heat-seekers since infrared ir is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies many objects such as people vehicle engines and aircraft generate and retain heat and as such are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background 26 heating edit main article infrared heating this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable

is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants it may also be used in other heating applications such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft de-icing 27 infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque absorbent objects rather than the air around them infrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes e.g curing of coatings forming of plastics annealing plastic welding and print drying in these applications infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating efficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the material cooling edit main article radiative cooling a variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared emissions to cool buildings or other systems the lwir 8–15 µm region is especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into space through the atmosphere communications edit ir data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants these devices usually conform to standards published by irda the infrared data association remote controls and irda devices use infrared light-emitting diodes leds to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam the beam is modulated i.e switched on and off to prevent interference from other sources of infrared like sunlight or artificial lighting the receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current it responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density ir does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances infrared remote control protocols like rc-5 sirc are used to communicate with infrared free space optical communication using infrared lasers can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabit s compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable except for the radiation damage since the eye cannot detect ir blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen 28 infrared lasers are used to provide the light for optical fiber communications systems infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330 nm least dispersion or 1,550 nm best transmission are the best choices for standard silica fibers ir data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the rias remote infrared audible signage project transmitting ir data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as beaming spectroscopy edit infrared vibrational spectroscopy see also near-infrared spectroscopy is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond a group of atoms in a molecule e.g. ch2 may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole if an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency the vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light typically the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000–400 cm−1 the mid-infrared a spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded this can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity for example a wet sample will show a broad o-h absorption around 3200 cm−1 thin film metrology edit in the semiconductor industry infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures by measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer the index of refraction n and the extinction coefficient k can be determined via the forouhi-bloomer dispersion equations the reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension depth and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures meteorology edit ir satellite picture taken 1315 z on 15th october 2006 a frontal system can be seen in the gulf of mexico with embedded cumulonimbus cloud shallower cumulus and stratocumulus can be seen off the eastern seaboard weather satellites equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types to calculate land and surface water temperatures and to locate ocean surface features the scanning is typically in the range 10.3–12.5 µm ir4 and ir5 channels high cold ice clouds such as cirrus or cumulonimbus show up bright white lower warmer clouds such as stratus or stratocumulus show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black one disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up however using the difference in brightness of the ir4 channel 10.3–11.5 µm and the near-infrared channel 1.58–1.64 µm low cloud can be distinguished producing a fog satellite picture the main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied these infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the gulf stream which are valuable to the shipping industry fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea even el niño phenomena can be spotted using color-digitized techniques the gray-shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information the main water vapour channel at 6.40 to 7.08 µm can be imaged by some weather satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere climatology edit in the field of climatology atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere these trends provide information on long-term changes in earth s climate it is one of the primary parameters studied in research into global warming together with solar radiation schematic of the greenhouse effect a pyrgeometer is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous outdoor measurements this is a broadband infrared radiometer with sensitivity for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5 µm and 50 µm astronomy edit main articles infrared astronomy and far-infrared astronomy beta pictoris with its planet beta pictoris b the light-blue dot off-center as seen in infrared it combines two images the inner disc is at 3.6 µm astronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components including mirrors lenses and solid state digital detectors for this reason it is classified as part of optical astronomy to form an image the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources and the detectors are chilled using liquid helium the sensitivity of earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric windows this limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy the infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers cold dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected in the visible light spectrum the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet infrared light is also useful for observing the cores of active galaxies which are often cloaked in gas and dust distant galaxies with a high redshift will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths so they are more readily observed in the infrared 8 infrared cleaning edit infrared cleaning is a technique used by some motion picture film scanners film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan it works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels red green and blue the infrared channel in combination with the other channels is used to detect the location of scratches and dust once located those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting 29 art conservation and analysis edit the arnolfini portrait by jan van eyck national gallery london infrared reflectography  fr it es as called by art conservators 30 can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive manner in particular the underdrawing or outline drawn by the artist as a guide this often reveals the artist s use of carbon black which shows up well in reflectograms as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between – such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original artist this is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work in general the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version it also gives useful insights into working practices 31 among many other changes in the arnolfini portrait of 1434 left the man s face was originally higher by about the height of his eye the woman s was higher and her eyes looked more to the front each of his feet was underdrawn in one position painted in another and then overpainted in a third these alterations are seen in infrared reflectograms 32 recent progress in the design of infrared sensitive cameras made it possible to discover and depict not only underpaintings and pentimenti but entire paintings which were later overpainted by the artist 33 notable examples are picasso s woman ironing and blue room where in both cases a portrait of a man has been made visible under the painting as it is known today similar uses of infrared are made by conservators and scientists on various types of objects especially

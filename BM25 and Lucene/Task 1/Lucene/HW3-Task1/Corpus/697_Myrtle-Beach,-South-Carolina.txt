in murrells inlet prior to the arrival of europeans the long bay area was inhabited by the native waccamaw tribe the waccamaw used the river for travel and fished along the shore around little river waties island the primary barrier island along long bay has evidence of burial and shell mounds remains of the visiting waccamaw 4 the first european settler along long bay arrived in the late 18th century attempting to extend the plantation system outward towards the ocean 5 records are sparse from this period with most of the recorded history pieced together from old land grants documents these settlers were met with mixed results producing unremarkable quantities of indigo and tobacco as the coast s soil was sandy and most of the crop yields were of an inferior quality prior to the american revolution the area along the future grand strand was essentially uninhabited several families received land grants along the coast including the witherses john richard william and mary this family received an area around present-day wither s swash also known as myrtle swash or the eight-mile swash a separate grant was granted to james minor including a barrier island named minor island now waties island off of the coast near little river 6 mary wither s gravestone at prince george winyah episcopal church speaks to the remoteness of the former strand she gave up the pleasures of society and retired to long bay where she resided a great part of her life devoted to the welfare of her children 7 as the american colonies gained independence the area remained essentially unchanged and the coast remained barren george washington scouted out the southern states during his term traveling down the king s highway he stayed a night at windy hill part of present-day north myrtle beach and was led across wither s swash to georgetown by jeremiah vereen 8 the withers family remained one of the few settlers around myrtle beach for the next half-century in 1822 a strong hurricane swept the house of r f withers into the ocean drowning 18 people inside the tragedy made the withers family decide to abandon their plots along the coast left unattended the area began to return to forest 9 the burroughs and collins company of conway predecessor of modern-day burroughs chapin purchased much of the withers’ family land in 1881 and the growing community was called new town around the start of the 20th century a post office named withers to serve the site of the old swash in 1888 on february 28 1899 burroughs and collins received a charter to build the conway seashore railroad to transport timber from the coast to inland customers the railroad began daily service on may 1 1900 with two wood-burning locomotives one of the engines was dubbed the black maria and came second-hand from a north carolina logging operation after the railroad was finished employees of the lumber and railroad company would take train flatcars down to beach area on their free weekends becoming the first grand strand tourists 10 the railroad terminus was nicknamed new town contrasting it with the old town or conway around the start of the 20th century franklin burroughs envisioned turning new town into a tourist destination rivaling the florida and northeastern beaches burroughs died in 1897 but his sons completed the railroad s expansion to the beach and opened the seaside inn in 1901 11 around 1900 a contest was held to name the area and burroughs wife suggested honoring the locally abundant shrub the southern wax myrtle myrica cerifera the withers post office changed its name to myrtle beach soon afterward it incorporated as a town in 1938 and as a city in 1957 12 in 1937 myrtle beach municipal airport was built however it was promptly taken over by the united states army air

referendum and must consist of three five seven or nine members depending on the county the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the board of chosen freeholders or split into

study commission this box view talk edit starting in the 20th century largely driven by reform-minded goals a series of six modern forms of government was implemented this began with the walsh act enacted in 1911 by the new jersey legislature which provided for a three or five-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis this was followed by the 1923 municipal manager law which offered a non-partisan council provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council and introduced a council-manager government structure with an appointed manager responsible for day-to-day administration of municipal affairs the faulkner act originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981 offers four basic plans mayor-council council-manager small municipality and mayor-council-administrator the act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government the number of seats on the council seats selected at-large by wards or through a combination of both staggered or concurrent terms of office and a mayor chosen by the council or elected directly by voters most large municipalities and a majority of new jersey s residents are governed by municipalities with faulkner act charters municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a special charter with the approval of the new jersey legislature citation needed while municipalities

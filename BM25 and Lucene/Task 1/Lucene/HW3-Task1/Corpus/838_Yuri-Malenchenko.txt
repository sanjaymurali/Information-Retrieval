spacewalk during the sts-106 mission to the iss 11 on flight day three malenchenko and nasa astronaut ed lu conducted a 6-hour and 14 minute space walk the spacewalk started at 04 55 gmt on september 11 when the two spacewalkers exited the shuttle s airlock 12 the spacewalk s objective focused on routing and connecting nine power data and communications cables between the zvezda module and the zarya module as well as installing the six-foot-long magnetometer to the iss to serve as a compass showing the space station in respect to the earth this spacewalk marked the sixth spacewalk in support of the iss assembly and the 50th spacewalk in space shuttle history 13 expedition 32 flight engineer malenchenko participates in a spacewalk on 20 august 2012 on november 9 2007 malenchenko

and the purpose of the spacewalk was to prepare for the relocation of pressurized mating adapter pma-2 and the subsequent move of the harmony node to its permanent location as the first task the two spacewalkers disconnected the station to shuttle power transfer system sspts cables between the destiny laboratory and pma-2 next they disconnected eight other cables between pma-2 and the destiny malenchenko removed and replaced a failed electrical circuit box and together with whitson removed the active common berthing mechanism cover that was located at the outboard end of harmony next malenchenko moved back behind the z1 truss to reconfigure a power system removing an electrical jumper the spacewalk ended at 16.49 utc when the two spacewalkers returned to the iss the spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 55 minutes on 20 august 2012 malenchenko together with cosmonaut gennady padalka participated in his fifth career spacewalk 16 tasks assigned to the two cosmonauts included hardware relocations installations retrievals and deployments for the spacewalk malenchenko donned an orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe the duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes the spacewalk was delayed for about an hour due to a small leak between space station modules the spacewalk started from the pirs docking compartment module at 15 37 gmt the first task for padalka and malenchenko was to relocate the strela-2 boom from the pirs module to the forward end of the zarya module the relocation was needed since pirs module will be detached from the space station in the future for the arrival of the new multi-purpose laboratory module mlm nauka the next task completed by padalka and malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite the two cosmonauts also retrieved five debris shields from the pirs module prior to installing them on the zvezda module they also completed several get-ahead tasks since the both opted not to take rests during the night passes as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline they retrieved an external experiment called biorisk from the pirs module for return to earth and for added stability installed two structural support struts between the pirs module and the eva ladder padalka and malenchenko then both ingress the pirs module prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure to end a highly successful spacewalk yuri malenchenko in the cupola module during expedition 47 expedition 46 47 edit the soyuz tma-19m crew during a fit check malenchenko arrived at the iss soyuz tma-19m to join the expedition 46 crew he performed a manual docking due to a malfunction in the automatic docking system progress ms-1 was then scheduled for launch to the iss atop a soyuz 2.1a on 21 december planned

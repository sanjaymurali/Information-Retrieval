scale a tropical wave exited the coast of africa on september 16 it traversed steadily westward with the southern portion of the wave axis moving across northern south america on september 26 the wave entered the eastern pacific ocean near panama and slowly organized a weak low-level trough extended from the caribbean sea to south of mexico disrupting the normal flow of westward steering currents on october 3 the tropical wave developed a distinct area of deep convection and began to drift eastward to the south of mexico two days later a low-level circulation formed and midday on october 5 the system developed into tropical depression eighteen-e while located about 250 miles 410 km south-southwest of huatulco in the state of oaxaca 1 with an absence of vertical wind shear the depression drifted just south of due east and steadily organized the system developed banding features and a central dense overcast and early on october 6 the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named pauline while located about 295 miles 475 km south-southeast of salina cruz oaxaca a strong high pressure system eroded the trough over southeastern mexico which turned pauline to the northeast an eye feature developed late on october 6 and early the next day pauline intensified into a hurricane about 265 miles 425 km southeast of salina cruz after turning to the north and northwest 1 hurricane pauline off the mexican coast on october 7 pauline rapidly intensified after becoming a hurricane with favorable conditions for continued development and 18 hours after becoming a hurricane it attained a peak intensity of 135 mph 215 km h the winds of the hurricane weakened slightly to 115 mph 185 km h but on october 8 pauline re-strengthened to reach winds of 135 mph 215 km h a short distance off the coast of mexico the hurricane turned more to the west-northwest while paralleling the southern coast of oaxaca and pauline quickly weakened due to interaction with the mountainous terrain before landfall near puerto Ángel as a 110 mph 175 km h hurricane early on october 9 the tropical cyclone continued to weaken as it paralleled the coast a short distance inland on october 10 pauline dissipated over the state of jalisco 1 preparations edit early forecasts underestimated the peak intensity of pauline by 65 mph 105 km h on october 7 about 41 hours before landfall the government of mexico issued a hurricane warning from tapachula in chiapas to punta maldonado in guerrero shortly after pauline made landfall the warning was extended northwestward to manzanillo colima and later to puerto vallarta jalisco pauline s turn to the west-northwest near landfall was unexpected resulting in hurricane conditions with only a few hours notice in some areas 1 authorities in el salvador declared a national state of alert in response to the potential threat from the hurricane residents in flood-prone areas were warned of potential flash flooding 2 as the hurricane turned sharply to the northwest there are no reports of damage or deaths from pauline in the country 1 officials in puerto madero closed port facilities to all ships excluding ships in open seas seeking

rainfall from the storm caused severe flooding in portions of oaxaca and neighboring chiapas 45 a total of about 500 entire communities were destroyed in oaxaca the areas worst affected were zapotecos chatino and mixtecos 36 guerrero edit heavy rainfall led to severe mudslides and flooding throughout southern guerrero entire communities were nearly destroyed with some remaining flooded for a week

city 31 the luxury resort hotels near the beach were largely unaffected by the hurricane though residents in the shanty towns lost what little they had much of the city was covered in mud and

million pesos 48 aftermath edit memorial in acapulco to honor the victims from pauline volunteers from the mexican red cross quickly went to disaster areas with search and rescue teams 49 including using specially trained dogs to search for hurricane victims trapped under muddy areas of acapulco by four days after the storm each team was finding one or two corpses per day with officials stating the search could take weeks 34 in guerrero the teams rescued a total of 35 people from hazard 33 hours after the hurricane passed through the area relief works traveled by boat through flooded areas to assist the worst-hit areas the red cross provided food water clothing blankets water purification supplies milk powder and other non-perishable foods and medical supplies to those staying in government shelters in oaxaca guerrero and chiapas the mexican red cross also set up shelters to house and feed hundreds of displaced people and by four days after the storm the red cross distributed 100 tonnes of relief supplies to hurricane victims medical workers were also deployed to the area to aid the injured 49 officials set up emergency water purification plants in acapulco though water remained largely unavailable water trucks were sent to the city with thousands standing in line for fresh water tourists in luxury hotels of acapulco for the most part generally unaffected by the hurricane 34 and rapidly recovered while other parts of the city remained devastated 50 hotels were forced to use bottled water and ration their available water to as little as possible to provide water for the rest of the city 51 extreme price gouging occurred in the city following the hurricane with one consumer protection official reporting shopkeepers charging 200 percent more for milk 500 percent more for tortillas and 1000 percent more than usual for water 35 even though the government was blamed for lack of warnings and water shortages ernesto zedillo the president of mexico at that time cut his vacation in europe short to respond to the catastrophe 52 government officials set up 39 aid centers for acapulco citizens though some residents were unable to get food and water some residents suspected than the president and his institutional revolutionary party of taking aid supplies for their own purposes the president promised to seek charges and decided to close aid centers in favor of opening soup kitchens despite having the food the mexican army did not set up the kitchens nor was aid distributed at the aid centers 51 most of acapulco remained closed for at least a week after the hurricane 51 initially authorities around acapulco gave preference to clean up tourist areas which resulted in the scenic highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane causing some hotels to charge 40 percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back one airline offered two plane tickets for the price of one from mexico city to acapulco most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane 53 donations edit the governments of oaxaca and guerrero asked unicef for assistance specifically water tanks water pumps and construction material 33 international aid initially focused almost solely on the damage in acapulco by a week after the hurricane 500 communities in oaxaca remained isolated and without assistance with several large communities in guerrero not receiving any material aid by a week after the hurricane 36 the adventist development and relief agency organized about 7 tons of food and clothing and sent a bus of 40 people to help isolated villages in southern mexico 54 around ten days after the hurricane struck 20,000 people were still isolated from emergency crews and relief works causing the president to suspect people could begin starving to death helicopters were initially sent to the remote areas though severe fog and heavy rainfall after the hurricane grounded the operations the government worked to bring food to remote mountain communities though officials noted the serious risk in doing so 55 three days after the hurricane the american red cross sent an initial donation of 25,000 1997 usd and also sent plastic sheets for temporary roofing and cleaning supplies such as mops brooms buckets sponges bleach and cleaning chemicals 49 local chapters also offered assistance the chapter in san antonio texas sent cleaning kits and the chapter in los angeles delivered 2,000 comfort kits containing hygiene supplies and crossword puzzles for children 56 the german red cross also offered assistance 49 diseases edit the floodwaters from the hurricane combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern mexico leading to a widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases as a result government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the guerrero and oaxaca coasts thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera as a result of the spoiled water health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water in acapulco about two days after the hurricane passed the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30 minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust 34 at least twenty cases of cholera 53 and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported 57 most significantly there were 14,630 cases of malaria in 616 villages in oaxaca due to pauline this represented about 80 of the malaria cases in mexico during 1998 58 army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets to disinfect water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes two c-130 hercules planes and twenty helicopters airlifted food and water to smaller villages south of acapulco that were stranded for nearly a week after the hurricane 51 retirement edit less than a month after pauline hurricane rick struck the same general region which brought additional rainfall and hampered relief efforts compared to pauline however damage was minimal 59 because of the high death tolls and the extent of damage in mexico the name pauline was retired in the spring of 1998 by the world meteorological organization and will never again be used for a pacific hurricane 60 it was replaced by patricia in the 2003 season 61

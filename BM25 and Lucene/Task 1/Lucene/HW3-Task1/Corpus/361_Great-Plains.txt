plains 1 the great plains sometimes simply the plains is the broad expanse of flat land a plain much of it covered in prairie steppe and grassland that lies west of the mississippi river tallgrass prairie states and east of the rocky mountains in the united states and canada it embraces the entirety of the states of kansas nebraska south dakota and north dakota parts of the states of colorado montana new mexico oklahoma texas wyoming and reaches into the southern portions of the canadian provinces of alberta manitoba and saskatchewan the region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming the canadian portion of the plains is known as the prairies it covers much of alberta and southern saskatchewan and a narrow band of southern manitoba despite covering a relatively small geographic area the prairies are nevertheless home to the majority of each of the three provinces respective populations usage edit the term great plains is used in the united states to describe a sub-section of the even more vast interior plains physiographic division which covers much of the interior of north america it also has currency as a region of human geography referring to the plains indians or the plains states in canada the term is little used natural resources canada the government department responsible for official mapping and equivalent to the united states geological survey treats the interior plains as one unit consisting of several related plateaux and plains there is no region referred to as the great plains in the atlas of canada 2 in terms of human geography the term prairie is more commonly used in canada and the region is known as the prairie provinces or simply the prairies the north american environmental atlas produced by the commission for environmental cooperation a nafta agency composed of the geographical agencies of the mexican american and canadian governments uses the great plains as an ecoregion synonymous with predominant prairies and grasslands rather than as physiographic region defined by topography 3 the great plains ecoregion includes five sub-regions temperate prairies west-central semi-arid prairies south-central semi-arid prairies texas louisiana coastal plains and tamaulipus-texas semi-arid plain which overlap or expand upon other great plains designations 4 extent edit ecoregions of the great plains the great plains before the native grasses were ploughed under haskell county kansas 1897 showing a man sitting behind a buffalo wallow the region is about 500 mi 800 km east to west and 2,000 mi 3,200 km north to south much of the region was home to american bison herds until they were hunted to near extinction during the mid late 19th century it has an area of approximately 500,000 sq mi 1,300,000 km2 current thinking regarding the geographic boundaries of the great plains is shown by this map at the center for great plains studies university of nebraska–lincoln 1 the term great plains for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the rocky mountains was not generally used before the early 20th century nevin fenneman s 1916 study physiographic subdivision of the united states 5 brought the term great plains into more widespread usage before that the region was almost invariably called the high plains in contrast to the lower prairie plains of the midwestern states 6 today the term high plains is used for a subregion of the great plains geography edit the great plains are the westernmost portion of the vast north american interior plains which extend east to the appalachian plateau the united states geological survey divides the great plains in the united states into ten physiographic subdivisions coteau du missouri or missouri plateau glaciated – east-central south dakota northern and eastern north dakota and northeastern montana coteau du missouri unglaciated – western south dakota northeastern wyoming southwestern north dakota and southeastern montana black hills – western south dakota high plains – southeastern wyoming southwestern south dakota western nebraska including the sand hills eastern colorado western kansas western oklahoma eastern new mexico and northwestern texas including the llano estacado and texas panhandle plains border – central kansas and northern oklahoma including the flint red and smoky hills colorado piedmont – eastern colorado raton section – northeastern new mexico pecos valley – eastern new mexico edwards plateau – south-central texas and central texas section – central texas paleontology edit during the cretaceous period 145–66 million years ago the great plains were covered by a shallow inland sea called the western interior seaway however during the late cretaceous to the paleocene 65–55 million years ago the seaway had begun to recede leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain which the seaway had once occupied during the cenozoic era specifically about 25 million years ago during the miocene and pliocene epochs the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread the grasslands provided a new niche for mammals including many ungulates and glires that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets traditionally the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked however an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals giving rise to the grit not grass hypothesis 7 paleontological finds in the area have yielded bones of mammoths saber-toothed cats and other ancient animals 8 as well as dozens of other megafauna large animals over 100 lb  45 kg – such as giant sloths horses mastodons and american lion – that dominated the area of the ancient great plains for thousands to millions of years the vast majority of these animals became extinct in north america at the end of the pleistocene around 13,000 years ago 9 climate edit bison at the tallgrass prairie preserve in oklahoma a glimpse of the southern great plains in southern oklahoma north of burkburnett texas in general the great plains have a wide variety of weather through the year with very cold and harsh winters and very hot and humid summers wind speeds are often very high especially in winter grasslands are among the least protected biomes 10 humans have converted much of the prairies for agricultural purposes or to create pastures the great plains have dust storms mostly every year or so the 100th meridian roughly corresponds with the line that divides the great plains into an area that receive 20 in 510 mm or more of rainfall per year and an area that receives less than 20 in 510 mm in this context the high plains as well as southern alberta south-western saskatchewan and eastern montana are mainly semi arid steppe land and are generally characterised by rangeland or marginal farmland the region especially the high plains is periodically subjected to extended periods of drought high winds in the region may then generate devastating dust storms the eastern great plains near the eastern boundary falls in the humid subtropical climate zone in the southern areas and the northern and central areas fall in the humid continental climate many thunderstorms occur in the plains in the spring through summer the southeastern portion of the great plains is the most tornado active area in the world and is sometimes referred to as tornado alley flora edit the great plains are part of the floristic north american prairies province which extends from the rocky mountains to the appalachians history edit original american contact edit main article plains indians see also paleo-indians buffalo hunt under the wolf-skin mask george catlin 1832–33 the first americans paleo-indians who arrived to the great plains were successive indigenous cultures who are known to have inhabited the great plains for thousands of years over 15,000 years ago 11 12 humans entered the north american continent in waves of migration mostly over beringia the bering straits land bridge historically the great plains were the range of the bison and of the culture of the plains indians whose tribes included the blackfoot crow sioux cheyenne arapaho comanche and others eastern portions of the great plains were inhabited by tribes who lived in semi-permanent villages of earth lodges such as the arikara mandan pawnee and wichita european contact edit great plains in north dakota c 2007 where communities began settling in the 1870s 13 with the arrival of francisco vázquez de coronado a spanish conquistador the first recorded history of encounter between europeans and native americans in the great plains occurred in texas kansas and nebraska from 1540 to 1542 in that same time period hernando de soto crossed a west-northwest direction in what is now oklahoma and texas today this is known as the de soto trail the spanish thought the great plains were the location of the mythological quivira and cíbola a place said to be rich in gold over the next one hundred years founding of the fur trade brought thousands of ethnic europeans into the great plains fur trappers from france spain britain russia and the young united states made their way across much of the region making regular contacts with native americans after the united states acquired the louisiana purchase in 1803 and conducted the lewis and clark expedition in 1804–1806 more information about the plains became available and various pioneers entered the areas manuel lisa based in st louis established a major fur trading site at his fort lisa on the missouri river in nebraska fur trading posts were often the basis of later settlements through the 19th century more european americans and europeans migrated to the great plains as part of a vast westward expansion of population new settlements became dotted across the great plains the new immigrants also brought diseases against which the native americans had no resistance between a half and two-thirds of the plains indians are thought to have died of smallpox by the time of the 1803 louisiana purchase 14 early european settlements on the great plains edit french edit

new railroads across the plains brought hunters who killed off almost all the bison for their hides the railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to european farmers who rushed to settle the land they and americans as well also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain free farms land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns and those reached by the railroad had a chance while the others became ghost towns in kansas for example nearly 5000 towns were mapped out but by 1970 only 617 were actually operating in the mid-20th century closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether a town would flourish or struggle for business 15 much of the great plains became open range or rangeland where cattle roamed free hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle in the spring and fall ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale such ranching began in texas and gradually moved northward between 1866 and 1895 cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as dodge city kansas 16 and ogallala nebraska from there cattle were shipped eastward 17 see also cattle drives in the united states cattle herd and cowboy circa 1902 many foreign investors especially british financed the great ranches of the era overstocking of the range and the terrible winter of 1886 resulted in a disaster with many cattle starved and frozen to death theodore roosevelt a rancher in the dakotas lost his entire investment he returned east to reenter politics from then on ranchers generally raised feed to ensure they could keep their cattle alive over winter to allow for agricultural development of the great plains and house a growing population the us passed the homestead acts of 1862 it allowed a settler to claim up to 160 acres 65 ha of land provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it the provisions were expanded under the kinkaid act of 1904 to include a homestead of an entire section hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads sometimes building sod houses out of the very turf of their land many of them were not skilled dryland farmers and failures were frequent much of the plains were settled during relatively wet years government experts did not understand how farmers should cultivate the prairies and gave advice counter to what would have worked citation needed germans from russia who had previously farmed under similar circumstances in what is now ukraine were marginally more successful than other homesteaders the dominion lands act of 1871 served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in canada 18 social life edit grange in session 1873 the railroads opened up the great plains for settlement for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the east and europe homestead land was free for american settlers railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established immigrants poured in especially from germany and scandinavia on the plains very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves they clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife and numerous children to handle the many chores including child-rearing feeding and clothing the family managing the housework feeding the hired hands and especially after the 1930s handling paperwork and financial details 19 during the early years of settlement farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors after approximately one generation women increasingly left the fields thus redefining their roles within the family new technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles the scientific housekeeping movement promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping and home economics courses in the schools 20 although the eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the isolation of the lonely farmer and wife plains residents created busy social lives for themselves they often sponsored activities that combined work food and entertainment such as barn raisings corn huskings quilting bees 21 grange meetings church activities and school functions women organized shared meals and potluck events as well as extended visits between families 22 the grange was a nationwide farmers organization they reserved high offices for women and gave them a voice in public affairs 23 after 19th century edit withdrawal rates from the ogallala aquifer the region roughly centered on the oklahoma panhandle including southeastern colorado southwestern kansas the texas panhandle and extreme northeastern new mexico was known as the dust bowl during the late 1920s and early 1930s the effect of an extended drought inappropriate cultivation and financial crises of the great depression forced many farmers off the land throughout the great plains from the 1950s on many areas of the great plains have become productive crop-growing areas because of extensive irrigation on large landholdings the united states is a major exporter of agricultural products the southern portion of the great plains lies over the ogallala aquifer a huge underground layer of water-bearing strata dating from the last ice age center pivot irrigation is used extensively in drier sections of the great plains resulting in aquifer depletion at a rate that is greater than the ground s ability to recharge 24 population decline edit main article depopulation of the great plains the rural plains have lost a third of their population since 1920 several hundred thousand square miles of the great plains have fewer than 6 inhabitants per square mile 2.3 inhabitants per square kilometer —the density standard frederick jackson turner used to declare the american frontier closed in 1893 many have fewer than 2 inhabitants per square mile 0.77 inhabitants per square kilometer there are more than 6,000 ghost towns in the state of kansas alone according to kansas historian daniel fitzgerald this problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region in addition the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities the continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the great plains is not sustainable 25 and there has been a proposal – the buffalo commons – to return approximately 139,000 sq mi 360,000 km2 of these drier parts to native prairie land wind power edit wind farm in the plains of west texas the great plains contribute substantially to wind power in the united states in july 2008 oilman turned wind-farm developer t boone pickens called for the u.s to invest 1 trillion to build an additional 200,000 mw of wind power nameplate capacity in the plains as part of his pickens plan pickens cited sweetwater texas as an example of economic revitalization driven by wind power development 26 27 28 sweetwater was a struggling town typical of the plains steadily losing businesses and population until wind turbines came to the surrounding nolan county 29 wind power brought jobs to local residents along with royalty payments to landowners who leased sites for turbines reversing the town s population decline pickens claims the same economic benefits are possible throughout the plains which he refers to as north america s wind corridor

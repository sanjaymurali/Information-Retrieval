agence spatiale européenne ase 3 4 german europäische weltraumorganisation is an intergovernmental organisation of 22 member states 5 dedicated to the exploration of space established in 1975 and headquartered in paris france esa has a worldwide staff of about 2,000 6 and an annual budget of about €5.25 billion us 5.77 billion 2016 7 esa s space flight programme includes human spaceflight mainly through participation in the international space station programme the launch and operation of unmanned exploration missions to other planets and the moon earth observation science and telecommunication designing launch vehicles and maintaining a major spaceport the guiana space centre at kourou french guiana the main european launch vehicle ariane 5 is operated through arianespace with esa sharing in the costs of launching and further developing this launch vehicle the agency s facilities are distributed among the following centres esa science missions are based at estec in noordwijk netherlands earth observation missions at esa centre for earth observation in frascati italy esa mission control esoc is in darmstadt germany the european astronaut centre eac that trains astronauts for future missions is situated in cologne germany a research institute created in 2009 the european centre for space applications and telecommunications ecsat is at harwell england and the european space astronomy centre esac is located in villanueva de la cañada madrid spain history edit foundation edit main article esro estec buildings in noordwijk netherlands estec was the main technical centre of esro and remains so for the successor organisation esa after world war ii many european scientists left western europe in order to work with the united states although the 1950s boom made it possible for western european countries to invest in research and specifically in space-related activities western european scientists realised solely national projects would not be able to compete with the two main superpowers in 1958 only months after the sputnik shock edoardo amaldi italy and pierre auger france two prominent members of the western european scientific community met to discuss the foundation of a common western european space agency the meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries including harrie massey united kingdom the western european nations decided to have two agencies one concerned with developing a launch system eldo european launch development organization and the other the precursor of the european space agency esro european space research organisation the latter was established on 20 march 1964 by an agreement signed on 14 june 1962 from 1968 to 1972 esro launched seven research satellites esa in its current form was founded with the esa convention in 1975 when esro was merged with eldo esa had ten founding member states belgium denmark france germany italy the netherlands spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom 8 these signed the esa convention in 1975 and deposited the instruments of ratification by 1980 when the convention came into force during this interval the agency functioned in a de facto fashion esa launched its first major scientific mission in 1975 cos-b a space probe monitoring gamma-ray emissions in the universe which was first worked on by esro later activities edit mock-up of the ariane 1 the esa collaborated with nasa on the international ultraviolet explorer iue the world s first high-orbit telescope which was launched in 1978 and operated successfully for 18 years a number of successful earth-orbit projects followed and in 1986 esa began giotto its first deep-space mission to study the comets halley and grigg–skjellerup hipparcos a star-mapping mission was launched in 1989 and in the 1990s soho ulysses and the hubble space telescope were all jointly carried out with nasa later scientific missions in co-operation with nasa include the cassini–huygens space probe to which esa contributed by building the titan landing module huygens as the successor of eldo esa has also constructed rockets for scientific and commercial payloads ariane 1 launched in 1979 carried mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward the next two versions of the ariane rocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch system the ariane 4 which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established esa as the world leader citation needed in commercial space launches in the 1990s although the succeeding ariane 5 experienced a failure on its first flight it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market with 56 successful launches as of september 2011 the successor launch vehicle of ariane 5 the ariane 6 is under development and is envisioned to enter service in the 2020s the beginning of the new millennium saw esa become along with agencies like nasa jaxa isro csa and roscosmos one of the major participants in scientific space research although esa had relied on co-operation with nasa in previous decades especially the 1990s changed circumstances such as tough legal restrictions on information sharing by the united states military led to decisions to rely more on itself and on co-operation with russia a 2011 press issue thus stated 9 russia is esa s first partner in its efforts to ensure long-term access to space there is a framework agreement between esa and the government of the russian federation on cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and cooperation is already under way in two different areas of launcher activity that will bring benefits to both partners notable outcomes are esa s include smart-1 a probe testing cutting-edge new space propulsion technology the mars express and venus express missions as well as the development of the ariane 5 rocket and its role in the iss partnership esa maintains its scientific and research projects mainly for astronomy-space missions such as corot launched on 27 december 2006 a milestone in the search for extra-solar planets mission edit the treaty establishing the european space agency reads 10 esa s purpose shall be to provide for and to promote for exclusively peaceful purposes cooperation among european states in space research and technology and their space applications with a view to their being used for scientific purposes and for operational space applications systems esa is responsible for setting a unified space and related industrial policy recommending space objectives to the member states and integrating national programs like satellite development into the european program as much as possible 10 jean-jacques dordain – esa s director general 2003-2015 – outlined the european space agency s mission in a 2003 interview 11 today space activities are pursued for the benefit of citizens and citizens are asking for a better quality of life on earth they want greater security and economic wealth but they also want to pursue their dreams to increase their knowledge and they want younger people to be attracted to the pursuit of science and technology i think that space can do all of this it can produce a higher quality of life better security more economic wealth and also fulfill our citizens dreams and thirst for knowledge and attract the young generation this is the reason space exploration is an integral part of overall space activities it has always been so and it will be even more important in the future activities and programmes edit esa describes its work in two overlapping ways for the general public the various fields of work are described as activities budgets are organised as

cooperating state within esa by virtue of this accord the canadian space agency takes part in esa s deliberative bodies and decision-making and also in esa s programmes and activities canadian firms can bid for and receive contracts to work on programmes the accord has a provision ensuring a fair industrial return to canada 31 the most recent cooperation agreement was signed on 2010-12-15 with a

governments as well as from an annual contribution by the european union eu 36 the budget of esa was €5.250 billion in 2016 7 every 3–4 years esa member states agree on a budget plan for several years at an esa member states conference this plan can be amended in future years however provides the major guideline for esa for several years citation needed the 2016 budget allocations for major areas of esa activity are shown in the chart on the right 7 countries typically have their own space programmes that differ in how they operate organisationally and financially with esa for example the french space agency cnes has a total budget of €2015 million of which €755 million is paid as direct financial contribution to esa 37 several space-related projects are joint projects between national space agencies and esa e.g corot also esa is not the only european governmental space organisation for example european union satellite centre enlargement edit see also enlargement of the european space agency after the decision of the esa council of 21 22 march 2001 the procedure for accession of the european states was detailed as described the document titled the plan for european co-operating states pecs 38 nations that want to become a full member of esa do so in 3 stages first a cooperation agreement is signed between the country and esa in this stage the country has very limited financial responsibilities if a country wants to co-operate more fully with esa it signs a european cooperating state ecs agreement the ecs agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation in esa procurements the country can also participate in all esa programmes except for the basic technology research programme while the financial contribution of the country concerned increases it is still much lower than that of a full member state the agreement is normally followed by a plan for european cooperating state or pecs charter this is a 5-year programme of basic research and development activities aimed at improving the nation s space industry capacity at the end of the 5-year period the country can either begin negotiations to become a full member state or an associated state or sign a new pecs charter 39 many countries most of which joined the eu in both 2004 and 2007 have started to co-operate with esa on various levels applicant state eu

that “concrete cooperation is at an advanced stage” with these nations and that “prospects for mutual benefits are existing” 60 a separate space exploration strategy resolution calls for further co-operation with the united states russia and china on leo exploration including a continuation of iss cooperation and the development of a robust plan for the coordinated use of space transportation vehicles and systems for exploration purposes participation in robotic missions for the exploration of the moon the robotic exploration of mars leading to a broad mars sample return mission in which europe should be involved as a full partner and human missions beyond leo in the longer term 60 eu and the european space agency edit this article needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information june 2015 the political perspective of the european union eu was to make esa an agency of the eu by 2014 61 although this date was not met the eu is already the largest single donor to esa s budget and non-esa eu states are observers at esa the only current eu member state that has not signed an esa cooperation agreement is croatia in december 2014 the esa ministerial council authorised officials to begin discussions to establish formal co-operation with croatia 62 launch vehicle fleet edit esa has a fleet of different launch vehicles in service with which it competes in all sectors of the launch market esa s fleet consists of three major rocket designs ariane 5 soyuz-2 and vega rocket launches are carried out by arianespace which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the ariane 5 as well as cnes at esa s guiana space centre because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits launches from french guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher latitudes in addition equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra push of nearly 500 m s due to the higher rotational velocity of the earth at the equator compared to near the earth s poles where rotational velocity approaches zero ariane 5 edit main article ariane 5 ariane 5 eca transported to the ela-3 launch pad the ariane 5 rocket is esa s primary launcher it has been in service since 1997 and replaced ariane 4 two different variants are currently in use the heaviest and most used version the ariane 5 eca delivers two communications satellites of up to 10 tonnes into gto it failed during its first test flight in 2002 but has since made 71 consecutive successful flights as of march 2016 the other version ariane 5 es was used to launch the automated transfer vehicle atv to the international space station iss and will be used to launch four galileo navigational satellites at a time 63 64 in november 2012 esa agreed to build an upgraded variant called ariane 5 me mid-life evolution which will increase payload capacity to 11.5 tonnes to gto and feature a restartable second stage to allow more complex missions ariane 5 me is scheduled to fly in 2018 65 some of its new features will also be adopted by the next-generation launcher ariane 6 planned to replace ariane 5 in the 2020s esa s ariane 1 2 3 and 4 launchers the last of which was esa s long-time workhorse have been retired soyuz edit main article soyuz at the guiana space centre soyuz launch complex soyuz-2 also called the soyuz-st or soyuz-stk is a russian medium payload launcher ca 3 metric tons to gto which was brought into esa service in october 2011 66 67 esa entered into a €340 million joint venture with the russian federal space agency over the use of the soyuz launcher 9 under the agreement the russian agency manufactures soyuz rocket parts for esa which are then shipped to french guiana for assembly esa benefits because it gains a medium payload launcher complementing its fleet while saving on development costs in addition the soyuz rocket—which has been the russian s space launch workhorse for some 40 years—is proven technology with a very good safety record russia benefits in that it gets access to the kourou launch site due to its proximity to the equator launching from kourou rather than baikonur nearly doubles soyuz s payload to gto 3.0 tonnes vs 1.7 tonnes soyuz first launched from kourou on 21 october 2011 and successfully placed two galileo satellites into orbit 23,222 kilometres above earth 66 vega edit main article vega rocket vega is esa s carrier for small satellites developed by seven esa members led by italy it is capable of carrying a payload with a mass of between 300 and 1500 kg to an altitude of 700 km for low polar orbit its maiden launch from kourou was on 13 february 2012 68 the rocket has three solid propulsion stages and a liquid propulsion upper stage the avum for accurate orbital insertion and the ability to place multiple payloads into different orbits 69 70 ariane launch vehicle development funding edit historically the ariane family rockets have been funded primarily with money contributed by esa governments seeking to participate in the program rather than through competitive industry bids this has meant that governments commit multiyear funding to the development with the expectation of a roughly 90 return on investment in the form of industrial workshare esa is proposing changes to this scheme by moving to competitive bids for the development of the ariane 6 71 human space flight edit this section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information july 2011 history edit ulf merbold became the first esa astronaut to fly into space at the time esa was formed its main goals did not encompass human space flight rather it considered itself to be primarily a scientific research organisation for unmanned space exploration in contrast to its american and soviet counterparts it is therefore not surprising that the first non-soviet european in space was not an esa astronaut on a european space craft it was czechoslovak vladimír remek who in 1978 became the first non-soviet or american in space the first man in space being yuri gagarin of the soviet union — on a soviet soyuz spacecraft followed by the pole mirosław hermaszewski and east german sigmund jähn in the same year this soviet co-operation programme known as intercosmos primarily involved the participation of eastern bloc countries in 1982 however jean-loup chrétien became the first non-communist bloc astronaut on a flight to the soviet salyut 7 space station because chrétien did not officially fly into space as an esa astronaut but rather as a member of the french cnes astronaut corps the german ulf merbold is considered the first esa astronaut to fly into space he participated in the sts-9 space shuttle mission that included the first use of the european-built spacelab in 1983 sts-9 marked the beginning of an extensive esa nasa joint partnership that included dozens of space flights of esa astronauts in the following years some of these missions with spacelab were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by esa such as two missions by germany and one by japan with european astronauts as full crew members rather than guests on board beside paying for spacelab flights and seats on the shuttles esa continued its human space flight co-operation with the soviet union and later russia including numerous visits to mir during the latter half of the 1980s european human space flights changed from being the exception to routine and therefore in 1990 the european astronaut centre in cologne germany was established it selects and trains prospective astronauts and is responsible for the co-ordination with international partners especially with regard to the international space station as of 2006 the esa astronaut corps officially included twelve members including nationals from most large european countries except the united kingdom in the summer of 2008 esa started to recruit new astronauts so that final selection would be due in spring 2009 almost 10,000 people registered as astronaut candidates before registration ended in june 2008 8,413 fulfilled the initial application criteria of the applicants 918 were chosen to take part in the first stage of psychological testing which narrowed down the field to 192 after two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009 as well as formal interviews six new members of the european astronaut corps were selected five men and one woman 72 astronaut

d e now retired crew vehicles edit in the 1980s france pressed for an independent european crew launch vehicle around 1978 it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in november 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of hermes was introduced the craft was comparable to early proposals for the space shuttle and consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments with a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the ariane 5 rocket which was being developed at that time it was planned solely for use in low-earth orbit space flights the planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991 the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly with the fall of the soviet union esa looked forward to co-operation with russia to build a next-generation space vehicle thus the hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent the columbus space station programme had a similar fate in the 21st century esa started new programmes in order to create its own crew vehicles most notable among its various projects and proposals is hopper whose prototype by eads called phoenix has already been tested while projects such as hopper are neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade other possibilities for human spaceflight in co-operation with the russian space agency have emerged following talks with the russian space agency in 2004 and june 2005 77 a co-operation between esa and the russian space agency was announced to jointly work on the russian-designed kliper a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond leo e.g the moon or even mars it was speculated that europe would finance part of it a €50 million participation study for kliper which was expected to be approved in december 2005 was finally not approved by the esa member states the russian state tender for the project was subsequently cancelled in 2006 in june 2006 esa member states granted 15 million to the crew space transportation system csts study a two-year study to design a spacecraft capable of going beyond low-earth orbit based on the current soyuz design this project was pursued with roskosmos instead of the cancelled kliper proposal a decision on the actual implementation and construction of the csts spacecraft was contemplated for 2008 in mid-2009 eads astrium was awarded a €21 million study into designing a crew vehicle based on the european atv which is believed to now be the basis of the advanced crew transportation system design 78 in november 2012 esa decided to join nasa s orion programme the atv would form the basis of a propulsion unit for nasa s new manned spacecraft esa may also seek to work with nasa on orion s launch system as well in order to secure a seat on the spacecraft for its own astronauts 79 in september 2014 esa signed an agreement with sierra nevada corporation for co-operation in dream chaser project further studies on the dream chaser for european utilization or dc4eu project were funded including the feasibility of launching a europeanized dream chaser onboard ariane 5 80 81 cooperation with other countries and organisations edit esa has signed co-operation

eu 88 there are common goals between esa and the eu esa has an eu liaison office in brussels on certain projects the eu and esa co-operate such as the upcoming galileo satellite navigation system space policy has since december 2009 been an area for voting in the european council under the european space policy of 2007 the eu esa and its member states committed themselves to increasing co-ordination of their activities and programmes and to organising their respective roles relating to space 89 the lisbon treaty of 2009 reinforces the case for space in europe and strengthens the role of esa as an r d space agency article 189 of the treaty gives the eu a mandate to elaborate a european space policy and take related measures and provides that the eu should establish appropriate relations with esa former italian astronaut umberto guidoni during his tenure as a member of the european parliament from 2004 to 2009 stressed the importance of the european union as a driving force for space exploration since other players are coming up such as india and china it is becoming ever more important that europeans can have an independent access to space we have to invest more into space research and technology in order to have an industry capable of competing with other international players 90 the first eu-esa international conference on human space exploration took place in prague on 22 and 23 october 2009 91 a road map which would lead to a common vision and strategic planning in the area of space exploration was discussed ministers from all 29 eu and esa members as

uk space agency the partners provide delegates to represent the uk on the various esa governing bodies each partner funds its own programme the italian space agency agenzia spaziale italiana or asi was founded in 1988 to promote co-ordinate and conduct space activities in italy operating under the ministry of the universities and of scientific and technological research the agency cooperates with numerous entities active in space technology and with the president of the council of ministers internationally the asi provides italy s delegation to the council of the european space agency and

national institute for aerospace technique is a public research organization specialised in aerospace research and technology development in spain among other functions it serves as a platform for space research and acts as a significant testing facility for the aeronautic and space sector in the country nasa edit esa has a long history of collaboration with nasa since esa s astronaut corps was formed the space shuttle has been the primary launch vehicle used by esa s astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with nasa in the 1980s and 1990s the spacelab programme was an esa-nasa joint research programme that had esa develop and manufacture orbital labs for the space shuttle for several flights on which esa participate with astronauts in experiments in robotic science mission and exploration missions nasa has been esa s main partner cassini–huygens was a joint nasa-esa mission along with the infrared space observatory integral soho and others also the hubble space telescope is a joint project of nasa and esa future esa-nasa joint projects include the james webb space telescope and the proposed laser interferometer space antenna citation needed nasa has committed to provide support to esa s proposed marcopolo-r mission to return an asteroid sample to earth for further analysis citation needed nasa and esa will also likely join together for a mars sample return mission citation needed cooperation with other space agencies edit since china has started to invest more money into space activities the chinese space agency has sought international partnerships esa is beside the russian space agency one of its most important partners recently the two space agencies cooperated in the development of the double star mission 93 esa entered into a major joint venture with russia in the form of the csts the preparation of french guiana spaceport for launches of soyuz-2 rockets and other projects with india esa agreed to send instruments into space aboard the isro s chandrayaan-1 in 2008 94 esa is also co-operating with japan the most notable current project in collaboration with jaxa is the bepicolombo mission to mercury speaking to reporters at an air show near moscow in august 2011 esa head jean-jacques dordain said esa and russia s roskosmos space agency would carry out the first flight to mars together 95 international space

managed by esa now originate from the supranational budget of the european union however in recent years the ties between esa and the european institutions have been reinforced by the increasing role that space plays in supporting europe’s social political and economic policies the legal basis for the eu esa co-operation is provided by a framework agreement which entered into force in may 2004 according to this agreement the european commission and esa co-ordinate their actions through the joint secretariat a small team of ec’s administrators and esa executive the member states of the two organisations meet at ministerial level in the space council which is a concomitant meeting of the eu and esa councils prepared by member states representatives in the high-level space policy group hspg esa maintains a liaison office in brussels to facilitate relations with the european institutions guaranteeing european access to space edit in may 2007 the 29 european countries expressed their support for the european space policy in a resolution of the space council unifying the approach of esa with those of the european union and their member states prepared jointly by the european commission and esa’s director general the european space policy sets out a basic vision and strategy for the space sector and addresses issues such as security and defence access to space and exploration through this resolution the eu esa and their member states all commit to increasing co-ordination of their activities and programmes and their respective roles relating to space 101

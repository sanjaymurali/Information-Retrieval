meteorology severe weather weather forecasting weather portal v t e a cold wave known in some regions as a cold snap is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air specifically as used by the u.s national weather service a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture industry commerce and social activities the precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls and the minimum to which it falls this minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year 1 in the united states a cold spell is defined as the national average high temperature dropping below 20 °f −7 °c 2 effects edit a cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals including humans and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow grazing animals may be unable to reach needed food and die of hypothermia or starvation they often necessitate the purchase of foodstuffs to feed livestock at considerable cost to farmers cold spells are associated with increased mortality rates in populations around the world 3 both cold waves and heat waves cause deaths though different groups of people may be susceptible to different weather events 4 in developed countries more deaths occur during a heat wave than in a cold snap though the mortality rate is higher in undeveloped regions of the world globally more people die of cold weather than hot weather due to the rise in diseases like cold flu and pneumonia extreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipelines and mains to freeze even some poorly protected indoor plumbing ruptures as water expands within them causing much damage to property and costly insurance claims demand for electrical power and fuels rises dramatically during such times even though the generation of electrical power may fail due to the freezing of water necessary for the generation of hydroelectricity some metals may become brittle at low temperatures motor vehicles may fail when antifreeze fails or motor oil gels producing a failure of the transportation system to be sure such is more likely in places like siberia and much of canada that customarily get very cold weather fires become even more of a hazard during extreme cold water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable making firefighting more difficult the air during a cold wave is typically denser and thus contains more oxygen so when air that a fire draws in becomes unusually cold it is likely to cause a more intense fire winter cold waves that aren’t considered cold in some areas but cause temperatures significantly below average for an area are also destructive areas with subtropical climates may recognize unusual cold perhaps barely freezing temperatures as a cold wave in such places plant and animal life is less tolerant of such cold as may appear rarely the same winter temperatures that one associates with the norm for colorado ohio or bavaria are catastrophic to winter crops in places like florida,california or parts of south america that grown fruit and vegetables in winter cold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth resulting in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be harvested economically such cold waves have caused famines at times as deadly to plants as drought cold waves can leave a land in danger of later brush and forest fires that consume dead biomass one extreme was the so-called year without a summer of 1816 one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after volcanic eruptions that reduced incoming sunlight countermeasures edit in some places such as siberia extreme cold requires that fuel-powered machinery to be used even part-time must be run continuously internal plumbing can be wrapped and persons can often run water continuously through pipes energy conservation difficult as it is in a cold wave may require such measures as collecting people especially the poor and elderly in communal shelters even the homeless may be arrested and taken to shelters only to be released when the hazard abates 5 hospitals can prepare for the admission of victims of frostbite and hypothermia schools and other public buildings can be converted into shelters people can stock up on food water and other necessities before a cold wave some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates at least during the winter suitable stocks of forage can be secured before cold waves for livestock and livestock in vulnerable areas might be shipped from affected areas or even slaughtered smudge pots can bring smoke that prevents hard freezes on a farm or grove vulnerable crops may be sprayed with water that will paradoxically protect the plants by freezing and absorbing the cold from surrounding air most people can dress appropriately and can even layer their clothing should they need to go outside or should their heating fail they can also stock candles matches flashlights and portable fuel for cooking and wood for fireplaces or wood stoves as necessary however caution should be taken as the use of charcoal fires for cooking or heating within an enclosed dwelling is extremely dangerous due to carbon monoxide poisoning adults must remain aware of the exposure that children and the elderly have to cold historical cold waves edit contemporary cold waves since 2001 edit january 2017 european cold wave – a cold wave hit central and east europe at january 5 the lowest temperature was −45.4 °c −49.7 °f degrees 6 the cold caused at least 60 deaths there was also massive snowfall january 2016 east asia cold wave – caused over 100 known deaths across east asia south asia and southeast asia february 2015 north american cold wave – during the second half of february 2015 temperature records were broken in both sides of the spectrum extreme warm records were broken in the western half of the united states and extreme cold records were broken in the eastern half in addition to the extreme cold wave at its most brutal in the great lakes mid-atlantic and new england snowfall were reported as far south as tupelo mississippi huntsville alabama and shreveport louisiana the cold wave became widespread and all the remaining mild conditions from the west were pushed into northern mexico the cold wave even extended well into early march with a part of every u.s state except florida reported a snow cover by march 1 2015 november 2014 north american cold wave – between november 8 and november 23 a polar vortex similar to earlier in 2014 has a temporary comeback delivering the 2014–15 winter season s first three named winter storms astro bozeman and cato snowfall records were confirmed all over the midwest and the northeast especially around the great lakes buffalo new york was among the hardest hit in the unseasonably wintry november in addition to not being thanksgiving yet autumn colors were in the mix along with the deep winter snow early 2014 north american cold wave – on january 2–11 cold arctic air initially associated with a nor easter invaded the central and eastern united states and canada east of the rockies temperatures were even colder than the north pole and the south pole in many regions in the upper midwest and canada temperatures reached as cold as −37 °f −38 °c and did not even get out of the negative double-digit temps in many places including chicago the cold wave extended for a few more months bringing a continuous pattern of record-low temperatures to most of the central and upper eastern united states before the pattern finally ended in early april december 2013 north american cold wave – on december 1 the weakening of the polar vortex resulted in the jet stream shifting southward which allowed abnormally cold temperatures to intrude the central united states on december 6 a daily record snowfall of 0.1 inches 2 mm was set in the dallas–fort worth metroplex breaking the old record of trace amounts of snow set in 1950 7 8 the cold wave continued into december 10 before the temperatures returned to a more stable range spring 2013 north american cold wave – although the core winter of 2012–13 was fairly mild both march and april were unusually cold across the midwest resulting in sharp temperature contrasts from march 2012 to march 2013 all over the united states and canada this late cold wave was unexpected because february and march 2013 were both forecasted to be even milder and more springlike than february and march 2012 but instead turned out with a near-average february and an unusually cold march this same cold wave extended well into the month of april as four named winter storms walda xerxes yogi and zeus hammered through much of the northern united states especially across minnesota and the dakotas minnesota s winter even extended well into

plains and the prairie provinces early 2012 european cold wave – as of february 11 2012 at least 590 people died during a cold snap with temperatures falling below −35 °c −31 °f in some regions 9 ukraine is the worst hit with over 100 deaths related to the cold 10 winter of 2010–11 in great britain and ireland – it was referred to as the big freeze by national media in both united kingdom and

temperature of −1 °c 30.2 °f it easily broke the previous record of 0.1 °c 32.18 °f set in december 1981 a cold wave affected much of the deep south in the united states and florida in january and february 2010 2009–10 european cold wave – at least ninety were confirmed dead after record low temperatures and heavy snowfall across europe causes travel disruption to much of the continent including the british isles france the low countries germany austria italy poland the baltic states the balkans ukraine and russia it was the coldest winter and longest cold spell for thirty years in the united kingdom whilst temperatures in the italian alpine peaks reached low to an extreme of −47 °c −52.6 °f early 2009 european cold wave – early january gave most of europe especially in central and south very cold temperatures some places like germany france italy romania and spain had record cold temperatures well below 0 °c 32 °f most of the places were covered in snow and ice which caused school closings and airport delays large cities like paris madrid berlin and even marseille saw very cold temperatures with lots of snow and ice in northern italy most of germany in northern portugal and even along the coasts of the mediterranean in early february another cold front brought heavy snowfall to much of western europe with the heaviest snow falling in france northern italy the low countries and the united kingdom where parts of southern england had seen the worst snowfall in over eighteen years causing widespread travel disruption particularly around london 2008 alaska cold wave – in early february alaska experienced the coldest temperatures for eight years with fairbanks nearing −50 °f −45.6 °c and chicken alaska bottoming out at −72 °f −57.8 °c a mere eight °f 4.4 °c away from the record of −80 °f −62.2 °c the first half of january also brought unusual cold weather and heavy snow to widespread regions of china and the middle east july 2007 argentine winter storm – an interaction with an area of low pressure systems across argentina during the july 6 7 and 8 of 2007 and the entry of a massive polar cold snap resulted in severe snowfalls and blizzards and recorded temperatures below −32 °c −26 °f the cold snap advanced from the south towards the central zone of the country continuing its displacement towards the north during saturday july 7 on monday

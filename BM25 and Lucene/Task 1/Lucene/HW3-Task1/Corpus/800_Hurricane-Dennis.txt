storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the incipient tropical wave that became dennis was identified on june 26 2005 well-inland over africa 1 2 3 it later emerged over the atlantic ocean on june 29 and moved briskly to the west 1 dry air initially inhibited development 4 5 though once this abated the wave was able to consolidate into a tropical depression on july 4 1 the depression soon crossed grenada before entering the caribbean sea whereupon increasingly favorable environmental factors such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures fueled intensification 6 7 8 turning west-northwest the system achieved tropical storm status on july 5 and hurricane status the following day 1 formation of a well-defined eye and central dense overcast signaled dennis s intensification into a major hurricane on july 7 1 9 throughout this phase the hurricane traversed the jamaica channel bringing deadly floods to both jamaica and haiti 1 the powerful storm soon struck granma province cuba as a category 4 early on july 8 violent winds battered the province and caused extensive damage briefly weakening due to interaction with land dennis quickly regained its strength paralleling the western coast of cuba dennis attained its peak winds of 150 mph 240 km h later that day before making a second landfall in the country this time in matanzas province 1 resumed interaction with the mountains of cuba caused significant weakening 10 however once dennis emerged over the gulf of mexico on july 9 it was able to quickly reorganize the hurricane reached category 4 strength for a third time on july 10 as it approached florida attaining its lowest barometric pressure of 930 mbar hpa 27.46 inhg 1 this ranked dennis as the strongest pre-august hurricane in the atlantic basin however this was eclipsed just six days later by hurricane emily which was the first july category 5 on record 11 12 weakening ensued as the hurricane approached the florida panhandle ultimately making landfall over santa rosa island on july 10 as a category 3 dramatic weakening ensued once the cyclone moved ashore dennis lingered as a tropical depression and remnant low for roughly a week

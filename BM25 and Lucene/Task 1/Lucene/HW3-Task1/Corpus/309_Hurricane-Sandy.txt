meteorological history main article meteorological history of hurricane sandy map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale hurricane sandy began as a low pressure system which developed sufficient organized convection to be classified as tropical depression eighteen on october 22 south of kingston jamaica 16 it moved slowly at first due to a ridge to the north low wind shear and warm waters allowed for strengthening 16 and the system was named tropical storm sandy late on october 22 17 early on october 24 an eye began developing and it was moving steadily northward due to an approaching trough 18 later that day the national hurricane center nhc upgraded sandy to hurricane status about 65 mi 105 km south of kingston jamaica 19 at about 1900 utc that day sandy made landfall near kingston with winds of about 85 mph 140 km h 20 just offshore cuba sandy rapidly intensified to winds of 115 mph 185 km h 3 and at that intensity it made landfall just west of santiago de cuba at 0525 utc on october 25 21 play media a time-lapse video made from nasa satellite images of hurricane sandy after sandy exited cuba the structure became disorganized 22 and it turned to the north-northwest over the bahamas 23 by october 27 sandy was no longer fully tropical and despite strong shear it maintained convection due to influence from an approaching trough the same trough turned the hurricane to the northeast 24 after briefly weakening to a tropical storm 25 sandy re-intensified into a hurricane 26 and on october 28 an eye began redeveloping 27 the storm moved around an upper-level low over the eastern united states and also to the southwest of a ridge over atlantic canada turning it to the northwest 28 sandy briefly re-intensified to category 2 intensity on the morning of october 29 around which time it had a wind diameter of over 1,150 miles 1,850 km 29 the convection diminished while the hurricane accelerated toward the new jersey coast 30 and the hurricane was no longer tropical by 2100 utc on october 29 31 about 2 1 2 hours later sandy made landfall near brigantine new jersey 32 with winds of 80 mph 130 km h 3 during the next four days sandy s remnants drifted northward and then northeastward over ontario before merging with another low pressure area over eastern canada on november 2 3 33 forecasts on october 23 2012 the path of hurricane sandy was correctly predicted by the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts ecmwf headquartered in reading england nearly eight days in advance of its striking the american east coast the computer model noted that the storm would turn west towards land and strike the new york new jersey region on october 29 rather than turn east and head out to the open atlantic as most hurricanes in this position do by october 27 four days after the ecmwf made its prediction the national weather service and national hurricane center confirmed the path of the hurricane predicted by the european model the national weather service was criticized for not employing its higher-resolution forecast models the way that its european counterpart did a hardware and software upgrade completed at the end of 2013 enabled the weather service to make more accurate predictions and do so far more in advance than the technology in 2012 had allowed 34 relation to global warming see also tropical cyclones in relation to global warming according to ncar senior climatologist kevin e trenberth the answer to the oft-asked question of whether an event is caused by climate change is that it is the wrong question all weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be 35 although noaa meteorologist martin hoerling attributes sandy to little more than the coincidental alignment of a tropical storm with an extratropical storm 36 trenberth does agree that the storm was caused by natural variability but adds that it was enhanced by global warming 37 one factor contributing to the storm s strength was abnormally warm sea surface temperatures offshore the east coast of the united states—more than 3 °c 5 °f above normal to which global warming had contributed 0.6 °c 1 °f 37 as the temperature of the atmosphere increases the capacity to hold water increases leading to stronger storms and higher rainfall amounts 37 as they move north atlantic hurricanes typically are forced east and out to sea by the prevailing westerlies 38 in sandy s case this typical pattern was blocked by a ridge of high pressure over greenland resulting in a negative north atlantic oscillation forming a kink in the jet stream causing it to double back on itself off the east coast sandy was caught up in this northwesterly flow 38 the blocking pattern over greenland also stalled an arctic front which combined with the cyclone 38 mark fischetti of scientific american said that the jet stream s unusual shape was caused by the melting of arctic ice 39 trenberth said that while a negative north atlantic oscillation and a blocking anticyclone were in place the null hypothesis remained that this was just the natural variability of weather 36 sea level at new york and along the new jersey coast has increased by nearly a foot 300 mm over the last hundred years 40 which contributed to the storm surge 41

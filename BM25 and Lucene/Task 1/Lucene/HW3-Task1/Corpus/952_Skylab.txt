united states first space station orbiting earth from 1973 to 1979 when it fell back to earth amid huge worldwide media attention launched and operated by nasa skylab included a workshop a solar observatory and other systems necessary for crew survival and scientific experiments it was launched unmanned by a modified saturn v rocket with a weight of 170,000 pounds 77,111 kg lifting skylab into low earth orbit was the final mission and launch of a saturn v rocket which was famous for carrying the manned moon landing missions 2 skylab was not simply a place of habitation massive science experimentation was undertaken there when data from these experiments some of which were on physical film were returned to earth analysis of scientific and engineering data of each mission was completed skylab s solar observatory was one of its major functions solar science was significantly advanced by the telescope and its observation of the sun was unprecedented as the skylab program drew to a close nasa s focus had shifted to the development of the space shuttle through which nasa hoped to reduce the cost of space access compared to previous launch systems to transport astronauts to skylab there were a total of three manned expeditions to the station conducted between may 1973 and february 1974 each of these missions delivered a three-astronaut crew carried in the apollo command service module apollo csm launched atop the saturn ib rocket which is much smaller than the saturn v for the final two manned missions to skylab a backup apollo csm saturn ib was assembled and made ready in case an in-orbit rescue mission was needed but this backup vehicle was never flown the station was damaged during launch when the micrometeoroid shield separated from the workshop and tore away taking one of the main solar panel arrays with it and jamming the other main solar panel array so that it could not deploy this deprived skylab of most of its electrical power and also removed protection from intense solar heating threatening to make it unusable however the first crew was able to save skylab by deploying a replacement heat shade and freeing the jammed solar panels this was the first time a repair of this magnitude was performed in space skylab included the apollo telescope mount a multi-spectral solar observatory multiple docking adapter with two docking ports airlock module with extravehicular activity eva hatches and the orbital workshop the main habitable space inside skylab electrical power came from solar arrays as well as fuel cells in the docked apollo csm the rear of the station included a large waste tank propellant tanks for maneuvering jets and a heat radiator numerous scientific experiments were conducted aboard skylab during its operational life and crews were able to confirm the existence of coronal holes in the sun the earth resources experiment package erep was used to view earth with sensors that recorded data in the visible infrared and microwave spectral regions thousands of photographs of earth were taken and the record for human time spent in orbit was extended beyond the 23 days set by the soyuz 11 crew aboard salyut 1 to as much as 84 days by the skylab 4 crew plans were made to refurbish and reuse skylab by using the space shuttle to boost its orbit and repair it however due to delays with the development of the space shuttle skylab s decaying orbit could not be stopped in the hours before re-entry nasa ground controllers attempted to adjust skylab s trajectory and orientation to try to minimize the risk of debris landing in populated areas 3 nasa s attempted target was a spot 810 miles 1,300 km south-southeast of cape town south africa skylab s atmospheric reentry began on july 11 1979 4 and people on earth and an airline pilot saw dozens of colorful firework-like flares as large pieces of the space station broke up in the atmosphere 5 skylab did not burn up as fast as nasa expected and skylab debris landed southeast of perth in western australia resulting in a debris path between esperance and rawlinna 4 over a single property in esperance 24 pieces of skylab were found 4 5 analysis of some debris indicated that the skylab station had disintegrated 10 mi 16 km above the earth much lower than expected 5 after skylab nasa space station laboratory projects included spacelab shuttle-mir and space station freedom which was later merged into the international space station background edit rocket engineer wernher von braun science fiction writer arthur c clarke and other early advocates of manned space travel expected until the 1960s that a space station would be an important early step in space exploration von braun participated in the publishing of a series of influential articles in collier s magazine from 1952 to 1954 titled man will conquer space soon he envisioned a large circular station 250 feet 75m in diameter that would rotate to generate artificial gravity and require a fleet of 7,000-ton 6,500-metric ton space shuttles for construction in orbit the 80 men aboard the station would include astronomers operating a telescope meteorologists to forecast the weather and soldiers to conduct surveillance von braun expected that future expeditions to the moon and mars would leave from the station 6 the development of the transistor the solar cell and telemetry led in the 1950s and early 1960s to unmanned satellites that could take photographs of weather patterns or enemy nuclear weapons and send them to earth a large station was no longer necessary for such purposes and the united states apollo program to send men to the moon chose a mission mode that would not need in-orbit assembly a smaller station that a single rocket could launch retained value however for scientific purposes 7 early studies edit in 1959 von braun head of the development operations division at the army ballistic missile agency submitted his final project horizon plans to the u.s army the overall goal of horizon was to place men on the moon a mission that would soon be taken over by the rapidly forming nasa although concentrating on the moon missions von braun also detailed an orbiting laboratory built out of a horizon upper stage 8 an idea used for skylab 9 a number of nasa centers studied various space station designs in the early 1960s studies generally looked at platforms launched by the saturn v followed up by crews launched on saturn ib using an apollo command service module 10 or a gemini capsule 11 on a titan ii-c the latter being much less expensive in the case where cargo was not needed proposals ranged from an apollo-based station with two to three men or a small canister for four men with gemini capsules resupplying it to a large rotating station with 24 men and an operating lifetime of about five years 12 a proposal to study the use of a saturn s-ivb as a manned space laboratory was documented in 1962 by the douglas aircraft company 13 air force plans edit illustration for mol the department of defense dod and nasa cooperated closely in many areas of space 14 in september 1963 nasa and the dod agreed to cooperate in building a space station 15 the dod wanted its own manned facility however 16 and in december it announced manned orbital laboratory mol a small space station primarily intended for photo reconnaissance using large telescopes directed by a two-man crew the station was the same diameter as a titan ii upper stage and would be launched with the crew riding atop in a modified gemini capsule with a hatch cut into the heat shield on the bottom of the capsule 17 18 19 mol competed for funding with a nasa station for the next five years 20 and politicians and other officials often suggested that nasa participate in mol or use the dod design 16 the military project led to changes to the nasa plans so that they would resemble mol less 15 development edit the floor grating of skylab under construction apollo applications program edit main article apollo applications program nasa management was concerned about losing the 400,000 workers involved in apollo after landing on the moon in 1969 21 a reason von braun head of nasa s marshall space flight center during the 1960s advocated for a smaller station after his large one was not built was that he wished to provide his employees with work beyond developing the saturn rockets which would be completed relatively early during project apollo 22 nasa set up the apollo logistic support system office originally intended to study various ways to modify the apollo hardware for scientific missions the office initially proposed a number of projects for direct scientific study including an extended-stay lunar mission which required two saturn v launchers a lunar truck based on the lunar module lem a large manned solar telescope using a lem as its crew quarters and small space stations using a variety of lem or csm-based hardware although it did not look at the space station specifically over the next two years the office would become increasingly dedicated to this role in august 1965 the office was renamed becoming the apollo applications program aap 23 as part of their general work in august 1964 the manned spacecraft center msc presented studies on an expendable lab known as apollo x short for apollo extension system apollo x would have replaced the lem carried on the top of the s-ivb stage with a small space station slightly larger than the csm s service area containing supplies and experiments for missions between 15 and 45 days duration using this study as a baseline a number of different mission profiles were looked at over the next six months wet workshop edit main article wet workshop von braun s sketch of a space station based on conversion of a saturn v stage 1964 in november 1964 von braun proposed a more ambitious plan to build a much larger station built from the s-ii second stage of a saturn v his design replaced the s-ivb third stage with an aeroshell primarily as an adapter for the csm on top inside the shell was a 10-foot 3.0 m cylindrical equipment section on reaching orbit the s-ii second stage would be vented to remove any remaining hydrogen fuel then the equipment section would be slid into it via a large inspection hatch this became known as a wet workshop concept because of the conversion of an active fuel tank the station filled the entire interior of the s-ii stage s hydrogen tank with the equipment section forming a spine and living quarters located between it and the walls of the booster this would have resulted in a very large 33-by-45-foot 10.1 by 13.7 m living area power was to be provided by solar cells lining the outside of the s-ii stage 24 one problem with this proposal was that it required a dedicated saturn v launch to fly the station at the time the design was being proposed it was not known how many of the then-contracted saturn vs would be required to achieve a successful moon landing however several planned earth-orbit test missions for the lem and csm had been canceled leaving a number of saturn ibs free for use further work led to the idea of building a smaller wet workshop based on the s-ivb launched as the second stage of a saturn ib a number of s-ivb-based stations were studied at msc from mid-1965 which had much in common with the skylab design that eventually flew an airlock would be attached to the hydrogen tank in the area designed to hold the lem and a minimum amount of equipment would be installed in the tank itself in order to avoid taking up too much fuel volume floors of the station would be made from an open metal framework that allowed the fuel to flow through it after launch a follow-up mission launched by a saturn ib would launch additional equipment including solar panels an equipment section and docking adapter and various experiments douglas aircraft builder of the s-ivb stage was asked to prepare proposals along these lines the company had for several years been proposing stations based on the s-iv stage before it was replaced by the s-ivb 25 an early wet workshop version of skylab on april 1 1966 msc sent out contracts to douglas grumman and mcdonnell for the conversion of a s-ivb spent stage under the name saturn s-ivb spent-stage experiment support module ssesm 26 in may astronauts voiced concerns over the purging of the stage s hydrogen tank in space nevertheless in late july it was announced that the orbital workshop would be launched as a part of apollo mission as-209 originally one of the earth-orbit csm test launches followed by two saturn i csm crew launches aap-1 and aap-2 mol remained aap s chief competitor for funds although the two programs cooperated on technology nasa considered flying experiments on mol or using its titan iiic booster instead of the much more expensive saturn ib the agency decided that the air force station was not large enough and that converting apollo hardware for use with titan would be too slow and too expensive 27 the dod later canceled mol in june 1969 28 dry workshop edit design work continued over the next two years in an era of shrinking budgets 29 nasa sought 450 million for apollo applications in fiscal year 1967 for example but received 42 million 30 in august 1967 the agency announced that the lunar mapping and base construction missions examined by the aap were being canceled only the earth-orbiting missions remained namely the orbital workshop and apollo telescope mount solar observatory the success of apollo 8 in december 1968 launched on the third flight of a saturn v made it likely that one would be available to launch a dry workshop 31 later several moon missions were canceled as well originally to be apollo missions 18 through 20 the cancellation of these missions freed up three saturn v boosters for the aap program although this would have allowed them to develop von braun s original s-ii based mission by this time so much work had been done on the s-iv based design that work continued on this baseline with the extra power available the wet workshop was no longer needed 32 the s-ic and s-ii lower stages could launch a dry workshop with its interior already prepared directly into orbit habitability edit labeled cut-away view of the main workshop a dry workshop simplified plans for the interior of the station 33 industrial design firm raymond loewy william snaith recommended emphasizing habitability and comfort for the astronauts by for example providing a wardroom for meals and relaxation 34 and a window to view earth and space although astronauts who participated in skylab planning were dubious about the designers focus on areas such as color schemes 35 habitability had not previously been an area of concern when building spacecraft due to their small volume and brief mission durations but the skylab missions would last for months 36 nasa sent a scientist on jacques piccard s ben franklin submarine in the gulf stream in july and august 1969 to learn how six people would live in an enclosed space for four weeks 37 astronauts were uninterested in watching movies on a proposed entertainment center or playing games but did want books and individual music choices 35 food was also important early apollo crews complained about its quality and a nasa volunteer found living on the apollo food for four days on earth to be intolerable its taste and composition in the form of cubes and squeeze tubes were unpleasant skylab food significantly improved on its predecessors by prioritizing edibility over scientific needs 38 each astronaut had a private sleeping area the size of a small walk-in closet with a curtain sleeping bag and locker 39 designers also added a shower 40 41 and a toilet 42 43 the latter was both for comfort and to obtain precise urine and feces samples for examination on earth 44 waste was put in a large waste tank that occupied a large section of below the ows although skylab did not have a system to recycle urine into drinking water for example it also did not dump trash into space to dispose of it trash and waste water were put in the trash airlock which injected it into the big waste tank its contents re-entered earth s atmosphere with the rest of skylab in 1979 rescue edit main article skylab rescue rescuing astronauts from skylab was possible in the most likely emergency circumstances the crew could use the csm to quickly return to earth if the station suffered serious damage if the csm failed the spacecraft and saturn ib for the next skylab mission would have been launched with two astronauts to retrieve the crew given skylab s ample supplies its residents would have been able to wait up to several weeks for the rescue mission 45 components edit major components of skylab component mass 2 46 47 habitable volume length diameter payload shroud 25,600 pounds 11,600 kg — 56.0 feet 17.1 m 21.6 feet 6.6 m

launch of the modified saturn v rocket carrying the skylab space station on august 8 1969 the mcdonnell douglas corporation received a contract for the conversion of two existing s-ivb stages to the orbital workshop configuration one of the s-iv test stages was shipped to mcdonnell douglas for the construction of a mock-up in january 1970 the orbital workshop was renamed skylab in february 1970 as a result of a nasa contest 48 the actual stage that flew was the upper stage of the as-212 rocket the s-ivb stage s-ivb 212 the mission computer used aboard skylab was the ibm system 4pi tc-1 a relative of the ap-101 space shuttle computers a saturn v originally produced for the apollo program—before the cancellation of apollo 18 19 and 20—was repurposed and redesigned to launch skylab 49 the saturn v s upper stage was removed but with the controlling instrument unit remaining in its standard position skylab was launched on may 14 1973 by the modified saturn v the launch is sometimes referred to as skylab 1 or sl-1 severe damage was sustained during launch and deployment including the loss of the station s micrometeoroid shield sun shade and one of its main solar panels debris from the lost micrometeoroid shield further complicated matters by pinning the remaining solar panel to the side of the station preventing its deployment and thus leaving the station with a huge power deficit 50 immediately following skylab s launch pad a at kennedy space center launch complex 39 was deactivated and construction proceeded to modify it for the space shuttle program originally targeting a maiden launch in march 1979 the manned missions to skylab would occur using a saturn ib rocket from launch pad 39b sl-1 would be the final unmanned launch from lc-39 until february 19 2017 when spacex crs-10 was launched manned missions edit skylab 3 s saturn ib at night july 1973 skylab in orbit in 1973 as flown docking ports in view solar prominence recorded by skylab on august 21 1973 51 three manned missions designated sl-2 sl-3 and sl-4 were made to skylab the first manned mission sl-2 launched on may 25 1973 atop a saturn ib and involved extensive repairs to the station the crew deployed a parasol-like sunshade through a small instrument port from the inside of the station bringing station temperatures down to acceptable levels and preventing overheating that would have melted the plastic insulation inside the station and released poisonous gases this solution was designed by nasa s mr fix it jack kinzler who won the nasa distinguished service medal for his efforts the crew conducted further repairs via two spacewalks extra-vehicular activity or eva the crew stayed in orbit with skylab for 28 days two additional missions followed with the launch dates of july 28 1973 sl-3 and november 16 1973 sl-4 and mission durations of 59 and 84 days respectively the last skylab crew returned to earth on february 8 1974 in addition to the three manned missions there was a rescue mission on standby that had a crew of two but could take 5 back down skylab 2 launched may 25 1973 skylab 3 launched july 28 1973 skylab 4 launched november 16 1973 skylab 5 cancelled skylab rescue on standby also of note was the three-man crew of skylab medical experiment altitude test who spent 56 days at low-pressure in 1972 on earth 52 this was a spaceflight analog test in full gravity but various skylab hardware and medical knowledge was gained orbital operations edit days in space mission skylab 2 28 skylab 3 60 skylab 4 84 skylab orbited earth 2,476 times during the 171 days and 13 hours of its occupation during the three manned skylab expeditions each of these extended the human record of 23 days for amount of time spent in space set by the soviet soyuz 11 crew aboard the space station salyut 1 on june 30 1971 skylab 2 lasted 28 days skylab 3 56 days and skylab 4 84 days astronauts performed ten spacewalks totaling 42 hours and 16 minutes skylab logged about 2,000 hours of scientific and medical experiments 127,000 frames of film of the sun and 46,000 of earth 53 solar experiments included photographs of eight solar flares and produced valuable results 54 that scientists stated would have been impossible to obtain with unmanned spacecraft 55 the existence of the sun s coronal holes were confirmed because of these efforts 56 many of the experiments conducted investigated the astronauts adaptation to extended periods of microgravity owen garriott performing an eva in 1973 a typical day began at 6 am central time zone 57 although the toilet was small and noisy both veteran astronauts—who had endured earlier missions rudimentary waste-collection systems—and rookies complimented it 58 41 59 the first crew enjoyed taking a shower once a week but found drying themselves in weightlessness 59 and vacuuming excess water difficult later crews usually cleaned themselves daily with wet washcloths instead of using the shower astronauts also found that bending over in weightlessness to put on socks or tie shoelaces strained their stomach muscles 60 breakfast began at 7 am astronauts usually stood to eat as sitting in microgravity also strained their stomach muscles they reported that their food—although greatly improved from apollo—was bland and repetitive and weightlessness caused utensils food containers and bits of food to float away also gas in their drinking water contributed to flatulence after breakfast and preparation for lunch experiments tests and repairs of spacecraft systems and if possible 90 minutes of physical exercise followed the station had a bicycle and other equipment and astronauts could jog around the water tank after dinner which was scheduled for 6 pm crews performed household chores and prepared for the next day s experiments following lengthy daily instructions some of which were up to 15 meters long sent via teleprinter the crews were often busy enough to postpone sleep 61 62 the station offered what a later study called a highly satisfactory living and working environment for crews with enough room for personal privacy 63 although it had a dart set 64 playing cards and other recreational equipment in addition to books and music players the window with its view of earth became the most popular way to relax in orbit 65 experiments edit the figure lists an overview of most major experiments 66 skylab 4 carried out several more experiments such as to observe comet kohoutek overview of most major experiments hurricane ellen of 1973 as seen from skylab film vaults and window radiation shield edit a labeled illustration of a skylab film vault from skylab a guidebook ep-107 by nasa skylab had certain features to protect vulnerable technology from radiation 67 the window was vulnerable to darkening and this darkening could affect experiment s190 67 as a result a light shield that could be open or shut was designed and installed on skylab 67 to protect a wide variety of films used for a variety of experiments and for astronaut photography there were 5 film vaults 68 there were four smaller film vaults in the multiple docking adapter which had to have four not one because each spar could not carry enough weight for single larger film vault 68 the orbital workshop could handle a single larger safe which is also more efficient for shielding 68 the large vault in the orbital workshop had an empty mass of 2398 lb 1088 kg 171.3 stones 68 67 the four smaller vaults had combined mass of 1545 lb 68 the primary construction material of all five safes was aluminum 68 when skylab re-entered there was one 180 lb chunk of aluminum found that was thought to be a door to one of the film vaults 69 the big film vault was one of the heaviest single pieces of skylab to re-enter earth s atmosphere 70 a later example of a radiation vault is the juno radiation vault for the juno orbiter for jupiter in that case it was designed to protect much of the unmanned spacecraft s electronics and it used 1 cm thick walls of titanium 71 the film vault was used for storing film from various sources including the apollo telescope mount solar instruments 72 six atm experiments used film to record data and over the course of the missions over 150 000 successful exposures were recorded 72 the film canister had to be manually retrieved on manned spacewalks to the instruments during the missions 72 the film canisters were returned to earth aboard the apollo capsules when each mission ended and were among the heaviest items that had to be returned at the end of each mission 73 the heaviest canisters weighed 40 kg and could hold up to 16,000 frames of film 73 gyroscopes edit skylab could change its attitude without using propellant by changing the spin of large gyroscopes there were two types of gyroscopes on skylab control-moment gyroscopes could physically move the station and rate gyroscopes measured the rate of rotation to find its orientation see control moment gyroscope cmg 74 the cmg helped provide the fine pointing needed by the apollo telescope mount and to resist various forces that can change the station s orientation 75 some of the forces acting on skylab that the pointing system needed to resist 75 gravity gradient aerodynamic disturbance internal movements of crew the skylab-a attitude and pointing control system has been developed to meet the high accuracy requirements established by the desired experiment conditions conditions must be maintained by the control system under the influence of external and internal disturbance torques such as gravity gradient and aerodynamic disturbances and onboard astronaut motion — skylab attitude and pointing control system 75 skylab was one of the first large spacecraft to use big gyroscopes that could control its attitude 76 the control could also be used to help point the instruments 76 the gyroscopes took about ten hours to get spun up if they were turned off 77 there was also a thruster system to control skylab s attitude 77 there were 9 rate-gyroscope sensors 3 for each axis 77 these were sensors that fed their output to the skylab digital computer 77 two of three were active and their input was averaged while the third was a backup 77 from nasa sp-400 skylab our first space station each skylab control-moment gyroscope consisted of a motor-driven rotor electronics assembly and power inverter assembly the 21-inch diameter rotor weighed 155 pounds and rotated at approximately 8950 revolutions per minute 78 there were three control movement gyroscopes on skylab but only two were required to maintain pointing 78 the control and sensor gyroscopes were part of a system that help detect and control the orientation of the station in space 78 other sensors that helped with this were a sun tracker and a star tracker 78 the sensors fed data to the main computer which could then use the control gyroscopes and or the thruster system to keep skylab pointed as desired 78 shower edit astronaut in the shower with curtain partially down july 1973 conrad in the skylab shower in 1973 earth testing showing partially and fully enclosed positions of the shower curtain skylab had a zero-gravity shower system in the work and experiment section of the orbital workshop 79 the shower that had a cylindrical curtain that went from the floor to ceiling and inside water was dispensed at the push of a button from a nozzle at the end of a flexible hose 80 in addition there was a vacuum system to suck away water 80 the floor of the shower in the usual orientation of this module had foot restraints 79 the user had to bring a bottle of pressurized water which was dispensed through the flexible hose 79 liquid soap was used with this shower and the use of both this soap and the water for showers were carefully planned out as with most items on the station 79 the first astronaut to use the space shower was paul j weitz on skylab 2 the first manned mission 79 the system was designed for up to 6 pints 3 4 of a gallon or about 2.84 liters of water per shower 81 the water was dispensed from a push button nozzle attached to flexible hose which took water from the personal hygiene tank 82 the shower curtain had several hoop rings and soft fabric to contain the water and or soap that may float in the lack of gravity which would be sucked up by a vacuum system 81 skylab also supplied astronauts with rayon terrycloth towels which had a color-coded stitching for each crew-member 83 in all there were 420 towels on board skylab initially 79 the normal allotment was that there was enough liquid soap and warm water for one shower per week per person 84 .it took a fair amount longer to use than you might expect but you come out smelling good — astronaut weitz as quoted in sp-400 skylab our first space station 83 in the 1980s there was a plan to remove the skylab b to prepare for future space station plans 81 scientists would spend 9 months testing and trying to improve the design for the future space station 81 it was possible to remove it from the national air and space museum and use it since it was a functional flight spare 81 as it turned out the habitation module was not deployed for what morphed into the international space station inhabitants of the shuttle did not have an enclosed shower they had to take sponge baths 85 similarly though there was device to dispense water even hot water and a vacuuming system 85 one of the big concerns with bathing in space is that the small droplets of water do not cause an electrical short by floating into the wrong area 85 like the rest of the interior especially the crew areas were designed by nasa scientists and engineers but also with input from famed industrial designer raymond loewy who was employed as a habitability consultant 86 87 procedure for operating the shower 88 fill up the pressurized portable water bottle with hot water and attach that bottle to ceiling connect the hose and pull up the shower curtain spray down with water apply liquid soap and spray more water vacuum up all the fluids and stow items from start to finish a skylab shower would take about 2 and half hours 89 one aspect was not just taking the shower but closing it up afterwards because it was unwise to leave water droplets floating around 89 the vacuum water system fed to a centrifugal

for the shower enclosure was fire-proof beta cloth 82 the fabric was wrapped around hoops of 109 cm diameter the top hoop was connected to the ceiling 82 one of the suggestions was for the nozzle of the suction head to be more flexible increasing its utitlity 88 the hose for the spray head connected at the top of the shower 88 the shower could be collapsed down to the ground when not in use 88 a simulated skylab shower was also used during the 56-day earth bound skylab analog mission smeat 90 the report was that they though the in-orbit they thought the astronauts would find it a positive 90 during smeat the astronauts used the shower after heavy exercise 90 the skylab shower was designed and built at the manned spaceflight center 82 cameras and film edit a view of the skylab space

departs there was a variety of hand-held and fixed experiments that used various types of film in addition to the instruments in the atm solar observatory there was 35 and 70 mm film cameras there was also a tv camera on board this recorded an image electronically it was determined that film was predicted to fog up to due to radiation over the course of the mission 67 to counter-act this the film was stored in one of several different vaults 67 personal hand-held camera equipment 91 television camera westinghouse color 25-150mm zoom 16 mm film video camera maurer called the 16 mm data acquisition camera 91 the dac was capable of very low frame rates such as for engineering data films and it had independent shutter speeds and framing rates 92 it could be powered from a battery or from skylab itself 92 it could handle interchangeable lenses and various lens and also film types were provided during the missions 92 there was different options for frame rates 2 4 6 12 and 24

of view plans for re-use after the last mission edit skylab rescue vehicle apollo csm being removed from its saturn ib rocket after the last skylab misson the three crewed skylab missions used only about 16.8 of the 24 man-months of oxygen food water and other supplies stored aboard skylab 99 a fourth manned mission was under consideration which would have used the launch vehicle kept on standby for the skylab rescue mission 100 this would have been a 20-day mission to boost skylab to a higher altitude and do more scientific experiments 100 another plan was to use a teleoperator retrieval system trs launched aboard the space shuttle then under development to robotically re-boost the orbit 101 when skylab 5 was cancelled it was expected skylab would stay in orbit until the 1980s which enough time to overlap with the beginning of shuttle launches 101 other options for launching trs included the titan iii and atlas agena 101 none of these options received the level of effort and funding needed for execution before skylab s sooner-than-expected re-entry 101 skylab s internal systems were evaluated and tested from the ground and effort was put into plans for re-using it as late as 1978 102 though no one returned after the end of the sl-4 mission in february 1974 the crew left a bag filled with supplies to welcome visitors and left the hatch unlocked 103 nasa discouraged any discussion of additional visits due to the station s age 104 but in 1977 and 1978 when the agency still believed the space shuttle would be ready by 1979 it completed two studies on reusing the station 103 105 by september 1978 the agency believed skylab was safe for crews with all major systems intact and operational 106 it still had 180 man-days of water and 420 man-days of oxygen and astronauts could refill both 103 the station could hold up to about 600 to 700 man-days of drinkable water and 420 man-days of food 107 before sl-4 left they did one more boost running the skylab thrusters for 3 minutes which added 11 km in height to its orbit 108 skylab was left in a 433 by 455 km orbit on departure 108 at this time the nasa-accepted estimate for its re-entry was nine years 108 .calculations made during the mission based on current values for solar activity and expected atmospheric density gave the workshop just over nine years in orbit slowly at first-dropping 30 kilometers by 1980-and then faster-another 100 kilometers by the end of 1982-skylab would come down and some time around march 1983 it would burn up in the dense atmosphere — sp-4208 living and working in space a history of skylab chapter 19 108 the studies cited several benefits from reusing skylab which one called a resource worth hundreds of millions of dollars 109 with unique habitability provisions for long duration space flight 110 because no more operational saturn v rockets were available after the apollo program four to five shuttle flights and extensive space architecture would have been needed to build another station as large as skylab s 12,400 cubic feet 350 m3 volume 111 its ample size—much greater than that of the shuttle alone or even the shuttle plus spacelab 112 —was enough with some modifications for up to seven astronauts 113 of both sexes 114 and experiments needing a long duration in space 109 even a movie projector for recreation was possible 110 proponents of skylab s reuse also said repairing and upgrading skylab would provide information on the results of long-duration exposure to space for future stations 103 the most serious issue for reactivation was stationkeeping as one of the station s gyroscopes had failed 115 and the attitude control system needed refueling these issues would need eva to fix or replace the station had not been designed for extensive resupply however although it was originally planned that skylab crews would only perform limited maintenance 116 they successfully made major repairs during eva such as the sl-2 crew s deployment of the solar panel 117 and the sl-4 crew s repair of the primary coolant loop 118 119 120 the sl-2 crew fixed one item during eva by reportedly hit ting it with a hammer 121 some studies also said beyond the opportunity for space construction and maintenance experience reactivating the station would free up shuttle flights for other uses 109 and reduce the need to modify the shuttle for long-duration missions 122 even if the station were not manned again went one argument it would serve as a useful experimental platform 123 shuttle mission plans edit concept for proposed skylab re-boost the reactivation would likely have occurred in four phases 103 an early space shuttle flight would have boosted skylab to a higher orbit adding five years of operational life the shuttle might have pushed or towed the station but attaching a booster—the teleoperator retrieval system trs —to the station would have been more likely based on astronauts training for the task martin marietta won the contract for 26 million to design the apparatus 124 trs would contain about three tons of propellant 125 the remote-controlled booster had tv cameras and was designed for duties such as space construction and servicing and retrieving satellites the shuttle could not reach after rescuing skylab the trs would have remained in orbit for future use alternatively it could have been used to de-orbit skylab for a safe controlled re-entry and destruction 126 in two shuttle flights skylab would have been refurbished in january 1982 the first mission would have attached a docking adapter and conducted repairs in august 1983 a second crew would have replaced several system components in march 1984 shuttle crews would have attached a solar-powered power expansion package refurbished scientific equipment and conducted 30 to 90-day missions using the apollo telescope mount and the earth resources experiments over five years skylab would have been expanded to accommodate six to eight astronauts with a new large docking interface module additional logistics modules spacelab modules and pallets and an orbital vehicle space dock using the shuttle s external tank the first three phases would have required about 60 million in 1980s dollars not including launch costs other options for launching trs were titan iii or atlas agena 101 after departure edit skylab in february 1974 as sl-4 departs after a boost of 6.8 miles 10.9 km by sl-4 s apollo csm before its departure in 1974 skylab was left in a parking orbit of 269 miles 433 km by 283 miles 455 km 115 that was expected to last until at least the early 1980s based on estimates of the 11-year sunspot cycle that began in 1976 127 128 nasa first considered as early as 1962 the potential risks of a space station reentry but decided not to incorporate a retrorocket system in skylab due to cost and acceptable risk 129 the spent 49-ton saturn v s-ii stage which had launched skylab in 1973 remained in orbit for almost two years and made an uncontrolled reentry on january 11 1975 130 some debris most prominently the five heavy j-2 engines likely survived to impact in the north atlantic ocean although this event did not receive heavy media or public attention it was followed closely by nasa and the air force and helped emphasize the need for improved planning and public awareness for skylab s eventual reentry citation needed solar activity edit skylab captured this view of the sun british mathematician desmond king-hele of the royal aircraft establishment predicted in 1973 that skylab would de-orbit and crash to earth in 1979 sooner than nasa s forecast because of increased solar activity 128 greater-than-expected solar activity 131 heated the outer layers of earth s atmosphere and increased drag on skylab by late 1977 norad also forecast a reentry in mid-1979 132 a national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa scientist criticized nasa for using an inaccurate model for the second most-intense sunspot cycle in a century and for ignoring noaa predictions published in 1976 133 the reentry of the ussr s nuclear powered cosmos 954 in january 1978 and the resulting radioactive debris fall in northern canada drew more attention to skylab s orbit although skylab did not contain radioactive materials the state department warned nasa about the potential diplomatic repercussions of station debris 134 battelle memorial institute forecast that up to 25 tons of metal debris could land in 500 pieces over an area 4,000 miles long and 1,000 miles wide the lead-lined film vault for example might land intact at 400 feet per second 5 ground controllers re-established contact with skylab in march 1978 135 and recharged its batteries 3 although nasa worked on plans to reboost skylab with the space shuttle through 1978 and the trs was almost complete the agency gave up in december when it became clear that the shuttle would not be ready in time 124 136 its first flight sts-1 did not occur until april 1981 also rejected were proposals to launch the trs using one or two unmanned rockets 103 or to attempt to destroy the station with missiles 5 re-entry edit equirectangular projection relief map of the skylab reentry site and final orbits as predicted by nasa fragment of skylab recovered after its re-entry through earth s atmosphere on display at the u.s space rocket center skylab s demise was an international media event with merchandising of t-shirts and hats with bullseyes 5 and skylab repellant with a money-back guarantee 137 wagering on the time and place of re-entry and nightly news reports the san francisco examiner offered a 10,000 prize for the first piece of skylab delivered to its offices the competing chronicle offered 200,000 if a subscriber suffered personal or property damage 3 a nebraska neighborhood painted a target so the station would have something to aim for a resident said 137 nasa calculated that the odds of station re-entry debris hitting any human were 1 to 152 which when multiplied by 4 billion becomes 1 in 600 billion for a specific human 138 although the odds of debris hitting a city of 100,000 or more were 1 to 7 and special teams were readied to head to any country hit by debris and requesting help 3 the event caused so much panic in the philippines that then president ferdinand marcos appeared on national television to reassure the public 128 we assume that skylab is on the planet earth somewhere charles s harlan skylab mission controller 5 a week before re-entry nasa forecast that it would occur between july 10 to 14 with the 12th the most likely date and the royal aircraft establishment predicted the 14th 128 in the hours before the event ground controllers adjusted skylab s orientation to try to minimize the risk of re-entry on a populated area 3 they aimed the station at a spot 810 miles 1,300 km south southeast of cape town south africa and re-entry began at approximately 16 37 utc july 11 1979 4 the air force provided data from a secret tracking system able to monitor the reentry 139 the station did not burn up as fast as nasa expected due to a 4 calculation error debris landed about 300 miles 480 km southeast of perth western australia 4 and was found between esperance and rawlinna from 31° to 34°s and 122° to 126°e about 130–150 km 81–93 miles radius around balladonia residents and an airline pilot saw dozens of colorful fireworks-like flares as large pieces broke up in the atmosphere 5 the shire of esperance facetiously fined nasa a 400 for littering a fine which remained unpaid for 30 years 140 the fine was paid in april 2009 when radio show host scott barley of highway radio raised the funds from his morning show listeners and paid the fine on behalf of nasa 141 142 seventeen-year-old stan thornton found 24 pieces of skylab at his home in esperance a philadelphia businessman flew him his parents and his girlfriend to san francisco where he collected the examiner prize 4 5 in a coincidence for the organizers the annual miss universe pageant was scheduled to be held a few days later on july 20 1979 in perth a large piece of skylab debris was displayed on the stage 143 analysis of the debris showed that the station had disintegrated 10 miles 16 km above the earth much lower than expected 5 after the demise of skylab nasa focused on the reusable spacelab module an orbital workshop that could be deployed with the space shuttle and returned to earth the next american major space station project was space station freedom which was merged into the international space station in 1993 and launched starting in 1998 shuttle-mir was another project and led to the u.s funding spektr priroda

for the skylab rescue flights 145 brand and lind also trained for a mission that would have aimed skylab for a controlled deorbit 139 skylab b edit main article skylab b in addition to the flown skylab space station a second flight-quality backup skylab space station had been built during the program nasa considered using it for a second station in may 1973 or later to be called skylab b s-ivb 515 but decided against it launching another skylab with another saturn v rocket would have been very costly and it was decided to spend this money on the development of the space shuttle

davidson center in 2013 146 147 nasa transferred the backup skylab to the national air and space museum in 1975 on display in the museum s space hall since 1976 the orbital workshop has been slightly modified to permit viewers to walk through the living quarters 148 mission designations edit the numerical identification of the manned skylab missions was the cause of some confusion originally the unmanned launch of skylab and the three manned missions to the station were numbered sl-1 through sl-4 during the preparations for the manned missions some documentation was created with a different scheme slm-1 through slm-3—for those missions only william pogue credits pete conrad with asking the skylab program director which scheme should be used for the mission patches and the astronauts were told to use 1-2-3 not 2-3-4 by the time nasa administrators tried to reverse this decision it was too late as all the in-flight clothing had already been manufactured and shipped with the 1-2-3

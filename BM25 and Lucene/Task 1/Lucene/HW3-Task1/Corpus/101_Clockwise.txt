clockwise wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia    redirected from clockwise and counterclockwise jump to navigation search this article is about the direction for other uses see clockwise disambiguation the clockwise direction rotation can occur in two possible directions a clockwise typically abbreviated as cw motion is one that proceeds in the same direction as a clock s hands from the top to the right then down and then to the left and back up to the top the opposite sense of rotation or revolution is in north american english counterclockwise ccw or in commonwealth english anticlockwise acw terminology edit before clocks were commonplace the terms sunwise and deasil deiseil and even deocil from the scottish gaelic language and from the same root as the latin dexter right were used for clockwise widdershins or withershins from middle low german weddersinnes opposite course was used for counterclockwise citation needed the counterclockwise or anticlockwise direction the terms clockwise and counterclockwise can only be applied to a rotational motion once a side of the rotational plane is specified from which the rotation is observed for example the daily rotation of the earth is clockwise when viewed from above the south pole and counterclockwise when viewed from above the north pole clocks traditionally follow this sense of rotation because of the clock s predecessor the sundial clocks with hands were first built in the northern hemisphere see main article and they were made to work like sundials in order for a horizontal sundial to work in the northern hemisphere it must be placed looking northward then when the sun moves in the sky east to south to west the shadow cast on the opposite side of the sundial moves with the same sense of rotation west to north to east this is why hours were drawn in sundials in that manner and why modern clocks have their numbers set in the same way note however that on a vertical sundial such as those placed on the walls of buildings the shadow moves in the opposite direction and some clocks were constructed to mimic this the best-known surviving example is the astronomical clock in the münster cathedral whose hands move counterclockwise occasionally clocks whose hands revolve counterclockwise are nowadays sold as a novelty historically some jewish clocks were built that way for example in some synagogue towers in europe to accord with right-to-left reading in the hebrew language citation needed in 2014 under bolivian president evo morales the clock outside the legislative assembly in plaza murillo la paz was shifted to counterclockwise motion to promote indigenous values 1 usage edit shop-work edit typical nuts screws bolts bottle caps and jar lids are tightened moved away from the observer clockwise and loosened moved towards the observer counterclockwise in accordance with the right-hand rule to apply the right-hand rule place one s loosely clenched right hand above the object with the thumb pointing in the direction one wants the screw nut bolt or cap ultimately to move and the curl of the fingers from the palm to the tips will indicate in which way one needs to turn the screw nut bolt or cap to achieve the desired result almost all threaded objects obey this rule except for a few left-handed exceptions described below the reason for the clockwise standard for most screws and bolts is that supination of the arm which is used by a right-handed person to tighten a screw clockwise is generally stronger than pronation used to loosen sometimes the opposite left-handed counterclockwise reverse sense of threading is used for a special reason a thread might need to be left-handed to prevent operational stresses from loosening it for example some older cars and trucks had right-handed lug nuts on the right wheels and left-handed ones on the left wheels so that as the vehicle moved forward the lug nuts tended to tighten rather than loosen for bicycle pedals the one on the left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use similarly the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening a turnbuckle has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other some gas fittings are left-handed to prevent disastrous misconnections oxygen fittings are right-handed but acetylene propane and other flammable gases are unmistakably distinguished by left-handed fittings mathematics edit in trigonometry and mathematics in general plane angles are conventionally measured counterclockwise starting with 0° or 0 radians pointing directly to the right or east and 90° pointing straight up or north however in navigation compass headings increase clockwise around the compass face starting with 0° at the top of the compass the northerly direction with 90° to the right east a circle defined parametrically in a positive cartesian plane by the equations x cos t and y sin t is traced counterclockwise as the angle t increases in value from the right-most point at t 0 an alternative formulation with sin and cos swapped gives a clockwise trace from the upper-most point games and activities edit in general most card games board games parlor games and multiple team sports play in a clock-wise turn rotation in western countries and latin america with a notable resistance to playing in the opposite direction counter-clockwise traditionally and still continued for the most part turns pass counter-clockwise in many asian countries in western countries when speaking and discussion activities take part in a circle turns tend to naturally pass in a clockwise motion even though there is no obligation to do so curiously unlike with games there is usually no objection when the activity uncharacteristically begins in a counter-clockwise motion notably the game of baseball is played counter-clockwise in humans edit most left-handed people prefer to draw circles and circulate in buildings clockwise while most right-handed people prefer to draw circles and circulate in buildings counterclockwise this is believed to result from dominant brain hemispheres 2 though some attribute it to muscle mechanics 3

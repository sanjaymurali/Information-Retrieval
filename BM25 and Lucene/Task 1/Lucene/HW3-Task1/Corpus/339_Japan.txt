which is pronounced nihon or nippon and literally means the origin of the sun the character nichi 日 means sun or day hon 本 means base or origin 24 the compound therefore means origin of the sun and is the source of the popular western epithet land of the rising sun 25 the earliest record of the name nihon appears in the chinese historical records of the tang dynasty the old book of tang at the end of the seventh century a delegation from japan requested that nihon be used as the name of their country this name may have its origin in a letter sent in 607 and recorded in the official history of the sui dynasty prince shōtoku the regent of japan sent a mission to china with a letter in which he called himself the emperor of the land where the sun rises 日出處天子 the message said here i the emperor of the country where the sun rises send a letter to the emperor of the country where the sun sets how are you the king of na gold seal said to have been granted to na king of wa japan by emperor guangwu of han in 57 ce the seal reads 漢委奴國王 tokyo national museum prior to the adoption of nihon other terms such as yamato 大和 or great wa and wakoku 倭国 were used the term wa 和 is a homophone of wo 倭 pronounced wa by the japanese which has been used by the chinese as a designation for the japanese as early as the third century three kingdoms period 26 however the japanese disliked some connotation of wa 倭 which has been associated in china with concepts like dwarf or pygmy and it was therefore replaced with the substitute character wa 和 meaning togetherness harmony 27 28 the english word japan possibly derives from the historical chinese pronunciation of 日本 the old mandarin or possibly early wu chinese pronunciation of japan was recorded by marco polo as cipangu in modern shanghainese a wu dialect the pronunciation of characters 日本 japan is zeppen zəʔpən the old malay word for japan japun or japang was borrowed from a southern coastal chinese dialect probably fukienese or ningpo 29 —and this malay word was encountered by portuguese traders in south east asia in the 16th century 30 these early portuguese traders then brought the word to europe 31 the first record of this name in english is in a book published in 1577 and spelled giapan in a translation of a 1565 letter written by a portuguese jesuit luís fróis 32 33 from the meiji restoration until the end of world war ii the full title of japan was dai nippon teikoku 大日本帝國 meaning the empire of great japan 34 today the name nihon-koku nippon-koku 日本国 is used as a formal modern-day equivalent with the

populated countries in the world 74 the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north the boso triple junction off the coast of japan is a triple junction where the north american plate the pacific plate and the philippine sea plate meets japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent the subducting plates pulled japan eastward opening the sea of japan around 15 million years ago 75 japan has

plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on august 25 the us national hurricane center reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of disturbed weather that was located about 1,400 km 870 mi to the southeast of the cape verde islands 1 during that day the depression gradually developed further as it moved westwards under the influence of the subtropical ridge of high pressure that was located to the north of the system before during the next day the nhc reported that the system had become a tropical storm and named it david becoming a hurricane on august 27 it moved west-northwestward before entering a period of rapid intensification which brought it to an intensity of 150 mph 240 km h on august 28 slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane ravaged the tiny windward island of dominica on the 29th 2 david continued west-northwest and intensified into a category 5 hurricane in the northeast caribbean sea reaching peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph 280 km h and minimum central pressure of 924 millibars 27.3 inhg on august 30 an upper-level trough pulled david northward into hispaniola as a category 5 hurricane on the august 31 the eye passed almost directly over santo domingo capital of the dominican republic with over a million people living there at the

passage david struck eastern cuba as a minimal hurricane on september 1 it weakened to a tropical storm over land but quickly re-strengthened as it again reached open waters david turned to the northwest along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge and re-intensified to a category 2 hurricane while over the bahamas where it caused heavy damage despite initial forecasts of a projected landfall in miami florida the hurricane turned to the north-northwest just before landfall to strike near west palm beach florida on september 3 it paralleled the florida coastline just inland until emerging into the western atlantic ocean at new smyrna beach florida later on september 3 david continued to the north-northwest and made its final landfall just south of savannah georgia as a minimal hurricane on september 5 it turned to the northeast while weakening over land and became extratropical on the 6th over new york as an extratropical storm david continued to the northeast over new england and the canadian maritimes 2 david intensified once more as it crossed the far north atlantic clipping northwestern iceland before moving eastward well north of the faroe islands on september 10 3 4 preparations edit in the days prior to hitting dominica david was originally expected to hit barbados and spare dominica in the process however on august 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph 240 km h hurricane to make a direct hit on the southern part of dominica 5 even as it became increasingly clear that david was headed for the island residents did not appear to take the situation seriously this can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent furthermore dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930 thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population this proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation 5 6 some 400,000 people evacuated in the united states in anticipation of david 2 including 300,000 in southeastern florida due to a predicted landfall between the florida keys and palm beach of those 78,000

strong surf and moderate rainfall amounting to a maximum of 8.92 inches 227 mm in vero beach 11 though it made landfall as a category 2 storm the strongest winds were localized and the highest reported wind occurred in fort pierce with 70 mph 115 km h sustained and 95 mph 155 km h gusts 13 because the hurricane remained near the coastline hurricane david failed to cause extreme damage in

lack of power prevented communications and the outside world had little knowledge of the extent of the damage in dominica a citizen named fred white ended that by using a battery-operated ham radio to contact the world 5 in response to the severe agricultural damage the government initiated a food ration by two months after the storm assistance pledges amounted to over 37 million 1979 us from various groups around the world similar to the aftermath of other natural disasters the distribution of the aid raised concerns and accusations over the amount of food and material or lack thereof for the affected citizens 5 the hurricane destroyed some important landmarks including a significant part of the ruins of the fort young which had stood since the 1770s 21 another occurrence less typical of the aftermath of other natural disasters was the looting in supermarkets seaports and homes what was not destroyed by the hurricanes was stolen in the weeks after the storm 6 hms fife a royal navy county class destroyer was on its way back to the united kingdom when the hurricane struck and was turned back to provide emergency aid to the island sailing through mountainous seas the fife docked in the main harbor at roseau without assistance and was the only outside help for several days the crew provided work details and medical parties to offer assistance to the island and concentrated on the hospital buildings the airstrip and restoring power and water the ship s helicopter called humphrey took medical aid into the hills to assist people who were cut off from getting to other help by fallen trees the ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what was being done and how to get assistance this was the first time a royal navy ship had provided a public broadcast news service citation needed united states edit despite the casualties and damages attributed to david the storm s effects were not as bad as in other countries in particular south florida escaped relatively lightly because of this then nhc director neil frank was accused of overly stirring up panic before the arrival of david two local psychiatrists even claimed that the experience would make residents more complacent towards future storms however the nhc defended their methods with frank stating if we hadn t raised public alarm and our predictions had been more accurate the consequences would have been disastrous 7 one reporter who covered hurricane david was dick baumbach a journalist with today newspaper now known as florida today he along with news photographer scott maclay followed the path of the hurricane from miami to central florida in cocoa beach baumbach decided to ride out the hurricane in his home with two other

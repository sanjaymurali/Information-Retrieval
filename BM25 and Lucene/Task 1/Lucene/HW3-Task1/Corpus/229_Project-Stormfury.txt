project stormfury wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search 1966 photo of the crew and personnel of project stormfury project stormfury was an attempt to weaken tropical cyclones by flying aircraft into them and seeding with silver iodide the project was run by the united states government from 1962 to 1983 the hypothesis was that the silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane this led to the seeding of several atlantic hurricanes however it was later shown that this hypothesis was incorrect it was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective additionally researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes this finding called stormfury s successes into question as the changes reported now had a natural explanation the last experimental flight was flown in 1971 due to a lack of candidate storms and a changeover in noaa s fleet more than a decade after the last modification experiment project stormfury was officially canceled although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes project stormfury was not without merit the observational data and storm lifecycle research generated by stormfury helped improve meteorologists ability to forecast the movement and intensity of future hurricanes hypothesis edit the working hypothesis of project stormfury cloud seeding was first attempted by vincent schaefer and irving langmuir after witnessing the artificial creation of ice crystals langmuir became an enthusiastic proponent of weather modification 1 schaefer found that when he dumped crushed dry ice into a cloud precipitation in the form of snow resulted 2 with regard to hurricanes it was hypothesized that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide latent heat would be released this would promote the formation of a new eyewall as this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure gradient 3 even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane s winds would be beneficial since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed 4 a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness 4 due to langmuir s efforts and the research of schaefer at general electric the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum indeed schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on december 20 1946 by seeding a cloud 2 this caused ge to drop out for legal reasons schaefer and langmuir assisted the u.s military as advisors for project cirrus the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification its most important goal was to try to weaken hurricanes 5 project cirrus edit project cirrus was the first attempt to modify a hurricane it was a collaboration of the general electric corporation the us army signal corps the office of naval research and the us air force 1 after several preparations and initial skepticism by government scientists 6 the first attempt to modify a hurricane began on october 13 1947 on a hurricane that was heading west to east and out to sea 5 an airplane flew along the rainbands of the hurricane and dropped nearly 180 pounds 82 kilograms of crushed dry ice into the clouds 1 the crew reported pronounced modification of the cloud deck seeded 5 it is not known if that was due to the seeding next the hurricane changed direction and made landfall near savannah georgia the public blamed the seeding and irving langmuir claimed that the reversal had been caused by human intervention 6 cirrus was canceled 5 and lawsuits were threatened only the fact that a system in 1906 had taken a similar path as well as evidence showing that the storm had already begun to turn when seeding began ended the litigation 5 this disaster set back the cause of seeding hurricanes for eleven years at first the seeding was officially denied and it took years before the government admitted it according to the sept 12 1965 edition of the fort lauderdale news and sun-sentinel in 1947 a hurricane went whacky and twelve years later it was admitted the storm had in fact been seeded 7 between the projects edit eye of hurricane esther the united states weather bureau s national hurricane research project founded in 1955 had as one of its objectives to investigate the scientific validity of hurricane modification methods to this end silver iodide dispensers were tested in hurricane daisy in august 1958 the flares were deployed outside of the hurricane eyewall so this was an equipment test rather than a modification experiment the equipment malfunctioned in all but one of the flights and no conclusive data was acquired 5 the first seeding experiment since the cirrus disaster was attempted on september 16 1961 into hurricane esther by nhrp and the united states navy aircraft eight cylinders of silver iodide were dropped into esther s eyewall and winds were recorded as weakening by 10 percent 8 the next day more seeding flights were made this time the silver iodide did not fall into the eyewall and no reduction in windspeed was observed these two results were interpreted as making the experiment a success 9 the seedings into hurricane esther led to the establishment of project stormfury in 1962 project stormfury was a joint venture of the united states department of commerce and the united states navy 9 project baton edit the objective of project baton was the analysis of the life history of thunderstorms a department of defense research activity supported by the advanced research project agency project baton sought to expand understanding of storm physics as an aid to weather forecasting fire prevention and possibly for artificially controlling the weather dr helmut weickmann as an employee of the u.s army signal research and development laboratory and dr paul mcready of meteorology research inc. were joint leaders of the project baton team 10 during the 1962 july–august storm season in flagstaff arizona the scientists selected guinea pig storms and seeded them with chemicals effects were thoroughly analyzed from the ground and from the air with time-lapse motion picture cameras stereo still cameras storm radar lightning detectors and airborne heat sensors among the agents inserted in selected clouds were condensation nuclei which temporarily increased the number of water droplets in the cloud and pulverized dry ice which turns a portion of the cloud to fine snow crystals that remain aloft the utilization of these agents facilitated study of a storm s characteristics 10 project stormfury begins edit robert simpson became its first director serving in this capacity until 1965 11 there were several guidelines used in selecting which storms to seed the hurricane had to have a less than 10 percent chance of approaching inhabited land within a day 12 it had to be within range of the seeding aircraft and it had to be a fairly intense storm with a well-formed eye 8 the primary effect of these criteria was to make possible seeding targets extremely rare 13 no suitable storms formed in the 1962 season next year stormfury began by conducting experiments on cumulus clouds from august 17 to 20 of that year experiments were conducted in 11 clouds of which six were seeded and five were controls in five of the six seeded clouds changes consistent with the working hypothesis were observed 14 on august 23 1963 hurricane beulah was the site of the next seeding attempt it had an indistinct eyewall in addition mistakes were made as the seedings of silver iodide were dropped in the wrong places as a consequence nothing happened 9 the next day another attempt was made and the seeders hit their targets the eyewall was observed to fall apart and be replaced by another eyewall with a larger radius 14 the sustained winds also fell by twenty percent 14 all in all the results of the experiments on beulah were encouraging but inconclusive 15 in the six years after beulah no seedings were conducted for several different reasons in 1964 measurement and observation equipment was not ready to be used 14 the year after that all flights were used for additional experimentation in non-hurricane clouds 14 joanne simpson became its director beginning in 1965 11 16 while out to sea in august of the 1965 atlantic hurricane season stormfury meteorologists decided that hurricane betsy was a good candidate for seeding 12 however the storm immediately swung towards land and on september 1 the planned flights were canceled for some reason the press was not notified that there were no seedings and several newspapers reported that it had begun 12 as betsy passed close to the bahamas and smashed into southern florida the public and congress thought that seeding was underway and blamed stormfury 12 it took two months for stormfury officials to convince congress that betsy was not seeded and the project was allowed to continue 12 a second candidate hurricane elena stayed too far out to sea 14 after betsy two other hurricanes came close to being seeded hurricane faith was considered a likely candidate but it stayed out of range of the seeding planes 14 that same year recon flights were conducted into hurricane inez but there were no seedings 14 both the 1967 and 1968 seasons were inactive because of that there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons 14 the eye of hurricane debbie on august 20 dr r cecil gentry became the director of stormfury in 1968 17 there were no more near-seedings until 1969 in the interim equipment was improved what once was the primitive method of hand-dumping dry ice was replaced with rocket canisters loaded with silver iodide and then gun-like devices mounted on the wings of the airplanes that fired silver iodide into the clouds observation equipment was improved 12 additional reconnaissance data was utilized to modify the working hypothesis the new theory took cumulus towers outside the eyewall into account according to the revised theory by seeding the towers latent heat would be released this would trigger the start of new convection which would then cause a new eyewall since the new eyewall was outside the original one the first eyewall would be choked of energy and fall apart in addition since the new eyewall was broader than the old one the winds would be lower due to a less sharp pressure difference 12 hurricane debbie in 1969 provided the best opportunity to test the underpinnings of project stormfury in many ways it was the perfect storm for seeding it did not threaten any land it passed within range of seeding aircraft and was intense with a distinct eye 18 on august 18 and again on august 20 thirteen planes flew out to the storm to monitor and seed it on the first day windspeeds fell by 31 14 on the second day windspeeds fell by 18 14 both changes were consistent with stormfury s working hypothesis indeed the results were so encouraging that a greatly expanded research program was planned 19 among other conclusions was the need for frequent seeding at close to hourly intervals 20 the 1970 and 1971 seasons provided no suitable seeding candidates 14 despite this flights were conducted into hurricane ginger ginger was not a suitable storm for seeding due to its diffuse indistinct nature the seeding had no effect ginger was the last seeding done by project stormfury 14 after the seedings edit stormfury inside tropical storm dorothy atlantic hurricanes meeting all of the criteria were extremely rare which made duplication of the success reached with hurricane debbie extremely difficult meanwhile developments outside of meteorology hindered the cause of hurricane modification in the early 1970s the navy withdrew from the project 21 stormfury began to refocus its efforts on understanding rather than modifying tropical cyclones 22 at the same time the project s aircraft were nearing the end of their operational lifetimes at the cost of 30 million year unknown 21 two lockheed p-3 s were acquired due to the rarity of atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements plans were made to move stormfury to the pacific and experiment on the large number of typhoons there 13 this action required many of the same safety requirements as in the atlantic but had the advantage of a much higher number of potential subjects 21 the plan was to begin again in 1976 and seed typhoons by flying out of guam however political issues blocked the plan the people s republic of china announced that it would not be happy if a seeded typhoon changed course and made landfall on its shores 13 while japan declared itself willing to put up with difficulties caused by typhoons because that country got more than half of its rainfall from tropical cyclones 13 similar plans to operate stormfury in the eastern north pacific or in the australian region also collapsed 23 failure of the working hypothesis edit multiple eyewalls had been detected in very strong hurricanes before including typhoon sarah 24 and hurricane donna 25 although the double eyes were usually seen in very intense systems double eyewalls were also seen post-seeding in some of the seeded storms at the time however the only known times that rapid changes in eyewall diameter other than during presumably successful seedings was during rapid changes in intensity 26 it remained controversial whether the seedings caused the secondary eyewalls or whether it was just a natural cycle 27 basically if eyewall changes similar to those observed in seeded hurricanes were rare in unseeded tropical cyclones it would provide powerful evidence that project stormfury was successful conversely if such changes were common in unseeded systems it would throw doubt on the very hypothesis and assumptions driving project stormfury 28 data and observations began to accumulate that debunked stormfury s working hypothesis beginning with hurricanes anita and david flights by hurricane hunter aircraft encountered events similar to what happened in successfully seeded storms 28 anita itself had a weak example of a concentric eyewall cycle and david a more dramatic one 27 in august 1980 hurricane allen passed through the atlantic caribbean and gulf of mexico it also underwent changes in the diameter of its eye and developed multiple eyewalls all this was consistent with the behavior that would have been expected of allen had it been seeded thus what stormfury was accomplishing by seeding was also happening on its own 29 other observations in hurricanes anita david frederic and allen 30 also discovered that tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water and a great deal of ice crystals 31 the reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing 32 as cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect those observations called the basis for project stormfury into question in the middle of 1983 stormfury was finally canceled after the hypothesis guiding its efforts was invalidated 33 legacy edit in the sense of weakening hurricanes to reduce their destructiveness project stormfury was a complete failure because it did not distinguish between natural phenomena in tropical cyclones and the impact of human intervention 31 millions of dollars had been spent trying to do the impossible in the end project stormfury had two fatal flaws it was neither microphysically nor statistically feasible 33 in addition stormfury had been a primary generator of funding for the hurricane research division while the project was operational the hrd s budget had been around 4 million 1975 usd 16 million 2008 usd with a staff of approximately 100 people 34 today the hrd employs 30 people and has a budget of roughly 2.6 million each year 35 however project stormfury had positive results as well knowledge gained during flights proved invaluable in debunking its hypotheses 35 other science resulted in a greater understanding of tropical cyclones in addition the lockheed p-3 s were perfectly suitable for gathering data on tropical cyclones allowing improved forecasting of these monstrous storms 35 those planes are still used by the noaa today 36 cuban president fidel castro alleged that project stormfury was an attempt to weaponize hurricanes 37

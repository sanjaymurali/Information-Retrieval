scotia initially nova scotia – the 14th american colony as some called it – displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of britain and rebellion flared at the battle of fort cumberland 1776 and at the siege of saint john 1777 throughout the war american privateers devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of halifax these american raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral nova scotians into supporting the british by the end of the war nova scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack american shipping 26 british military forces based at halifax succeeded in preventing american support for rebels in nova scotia and deterred any invasion of nova scotia however

in 1784 the loyalist exodus created new communities across nova scotia including shelburne which briefly became one of the larger british settlements in north america and infused nova scotia with additional capital and skills however the migration also caused political tensions between loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing new england planters settlement the loyalist influx also pushed nova scotia s mi kmaq people to the margins as loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands as part of the loyalist migration about 3,000 black loyalists arrived they founded the largest free black settlement in north america at birchtown near shelburne however unfair treatment and harsh conditions caused about one-third of the black loyalists to resettle in sierra leone in

province alberta gdp growth has lagged behind the rest of the country for at least the past decade 41 nova scotia s traditionally resource-based economy has diversified in recent decades the rise of nova scotia as a viable jurisdiction in north america historically was driven by the ready availability of natural resources especially the fish stocks off the scotian shelf the fishery was a pillar of the economy since its development as part of new france in the 17th century however the fishery suffered a sharp decline due to overfishing in the late 20th century the collapse of the cod stocks

breton and northern mainland nova scotia has virtually ceased production and a large steel mill in sydney closed during the 1990s more recently the high value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has hurt the forestry industry leading to the shut down of a long-running pulp and paper mill near liverpool mining especially of gypsum and salt and to a lesser extent silica peat and barite

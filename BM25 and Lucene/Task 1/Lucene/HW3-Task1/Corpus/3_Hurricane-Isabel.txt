other wikis commons isabel images hurricane isabel was the costliest deadliest and strongest hurricane in the 2003 atlantic hurricane season the ninth named storm fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the season isabel formed near the cape verde islands from a tropical wave on september 6 in the tropical atlantic ocean it moved northwestward and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph 265 km h on september 11 after fluctuating in intensity for four days isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the outer banks of north carolina with winds of 105 mph 165 km h on september 18 it quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western pennsylvania the next day in north carolina the storm surge from isabel washed out a portion of hatteras island to form what was unofficially known as isabel inlet damage was greatest along the outer banks where thousands of homes were damaged or even destroyed the worst of the effects of isabel occurred in virginia especially in the hampton roads area and along the shores of rivers as far west and north as richmond and washington dc virginia reported the most deaths and damage from the hurricane about 64 of the damage and 68 of the deaths occurred in north carolina and virginia electric service was disrupted in areas of virginia for several days some more rural areas were without electricity for weeks and local flooding caused thousands of dollars in damage moderate to severe damage extended up the atlantic coastline and as far inland as west virginia roughly six million people were left without electric service in the eastern united states from the strong winds of isabel rainfall from the storm extended from south carolina to maine and westward to michigan throughout the path of isabel damage totalled about 7009537000000000000♠ 5.37 billion 2003 usd 7009699129703300000♠ 6.99 billion 2016 usd 1 16 deaths in seven u.s states were directly related to the hurricane with 35 deaths in six states and one canadian province indirectly related to the hurricane meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave moved off the western coast of africa on september 1 2 an area of low pressure associated with the wave moved slowly westward and its convection initially appeared to become better organized 3 on september 3 as it passed to the south of the cape verde islands organization within the system degraded 4 though convection increased the next day 5 the system gradually became better organized and dvorak classifications began early on september 5 based on the development of a closed surface circulation it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression thirteen early on september 6 hours later it intensified into tropical storm isabel 2 though operationally the national hurricane center did not begin issuing advisories until 13 hours after it first developed 6 located within an area of light wind shear and warm waters isabel gradually organized as curved bands developed around a circular area of deep convection near the center 7 it steadily strengthened as it moved to the west-northwest and isabel strengthened to a hurricane on september 7 subsequent to the development of a large yet ragged eye located near the deepest convection 8 the eye overall convective pattern and outflow steadily improved in organization 9 and deep convection quickly surrounded the 40-mile 60 km wide eye 10 isabel intensified on september 8 to reach major hurricane status while located 1,300 miles 2,100 km east-northeast of barbuda on september 9 isabel reached a primary peak intensity of 135 mph 215 km h for around 24 hours a minimal category 4 hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale 2 the eye of hurricane isabel as seen from the international space station broader view from the international space station early on september 10 the eyewall became less defined the convection near the eye became eroded and northeasterly outflow became slightly restricted 11 as a result isabel weakened slightly to a category 3 hurricane the hurricane turned more to the west due to the influence of the bermuda-azores high 2 later on september 10 isabel restrengthened to a category 4 hurricane after convection deepened near the increasingly organizing eyewall 12 the hurricane continued to intensify and isabel reached its peak intensity of 165 mph 270 km h on september 11 a category 5 hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale 2 due to an eyewall replacement cycle isabel weakened slightly though it retained category 5 status for 24 hours 13 as isabel underwent another eyewall replacement cycle outflow degraded in appearance and convection around the eye weakened 14 and early on september 13 isabel weakened to a strong category 4 hurricane a weakness in the ridge to its north allowed the hurricane to turn to the west-northwest 2 after completing the replacement cycle the hurricane s large 40 mile 65 km wide eye became better defined 15 and late on the 13th isabel re-attained category 5 status 2 a noaa hurricane hunter reconnaissance aircraft flying into the hurricane launched a dropsonde which measured an instantaneous wind speed of 233 mph 375 km h the strongest instantaneous wind speed recorded in an atlantic hurricane 16 cloud tops warmed again shortly thereafter 17 and isabel weakened to a strong category 4 hurricane early on september 14 later that day it re-organized and for the third time it attained category 5 status while located 400 miles 650 km north of san juan puerto rico 2 cloud tops around the center warmed again early on september 15 and isabel weakened to a category 4 hurricane 2 later that day the inner core of deep convection began to deteriorate while the eye decayed in appearance as a ridge to its northwest build southeastward it resulted in isabel decelerating as it turned to the north-northwest 18 increasing vertical wind shear contributed in weakening the hurricane further and isabel weakened to a category 2 hurricane on september 16 while located 645 miles 1035 km southeast of cape hatteras north carolina 2 convection remained minimal though outflow retained excellent organization 19 and isabel remained a category 2 hurricane for two days until it made landfall between cape lookout and ocracoke island on september 18 with winds of 105 mph 165 km h it weakened after it made landfall though due to its fast forward motion isabel remained a hurricane until it reached western virginia early on september 19 after passing through west virginia as a tropical storm isabel became extratropical over western pennsylvania near pittsburgh the system crossed lake erie into canada early on september 20 the extratropial remnant of isabel was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over the cochrane district of ontario 2 preparations edit hurricane isabel making landfall in north carolina on september 18 two days before isabel made landfall the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch from little river south carolina to chincoteague virginia including the pamlico and albemarle sounds and the lower chesapeake bay the nhc also issued a tropical storm watch south of little river south carolina to the mouth of the santee river as well as from chincoteague virginia northward to little egg inlet new jersey hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the east coast of the united states by the time isabel made landfall a tropical storm warning existed from chincoteague virginia to fire island new york and from cape fear north carolina to the mouth of the santee river in south carolina and a hurricane warning existed from chincoteague virginia to cape fear landfall forecasts were very accurate from three days prior the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36 miles 58 km and for 48 hours in advance the average track error was 18 miles 29 km 2 officials declared mandatory evacuations for 24 counties in north carolina virginia and maryland though in general not many left according to a survey conducted by the united states department of commerce evacuation rates were estimated as follows 45 in the outer banks 23 in the area around the pamlico sound 23 in virginia and about 15 in maryland 20 the threat of isabel resulted in the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents primarily in north carolina and virginia and included more than 12,000 residents staying in emergency shelters 21 19 major airports along the east coast of the united states were closed with more than 1,500 flights canceled the washington metro and metrobus system closed prior to the arrival of the storm and amtrak canceled nearly all trains south of the nation s capital schools and businesses throughout its path closed prior to isabel s arrival to allow time to prepare hardware and home improvement stores reported brisk business of plywood flashlights batteries and portable generators as residents prepared for the storm s potential impact the federal government was closed excluding emergency staff members 21 the united states navy ordered the removal of 40 ships and submarines and dozens of aircraft from naval sites near norfolk virginia 22 a contingency plan was established at the tomb of the unknowns at arlington national cemetery that should the winds exceed 120mph the guards could take positions in the trophy room above the tomb plaza and providing continual sight of the tomb but the plan was never implemented however it spawned an urban legend that the third infantry sent orders to seek shelter orders that were deliberately disobeyed 23 on september 18 the canadian hurricane centre issued heavy rainfall and wind warnings for portions of southern ontario a gale warning was also issued for lake ontario eastern lake erie the saint lawrence river and georgian bay 24 25 26 a news report on september 14 warned conditions could be similar to the disaster caused by hurricane hazel 49 years prior resulting in widespread media coverage on the hurricane 27 researchers on a convair 580 flight studied the structure of isabel transitioning into an extratropical storm after two similar studies for hurricane michael in 2000 and tropical storm karen in 2001 while flying in a thunderstorm ice build forced the plane to descend 28 impact edit deaths and damage by region

names damage to the barrier islands after hurricane isabel usgs by about a week after the passage of the hurricane president george w bush declared disaster areas for 36 north carolina counties 77 counties and independent cities in virginia the entire state of maryland all three counties in delaware and six west virginia counties the disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane isabel 20 by about four months after the passage of the hurricane disaster aid totaled about 516 million 2003 usd 672 million 2017 usd primarily in north carolina and virginia over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance with about 117 million 2003 usd 152 million 2017 usd approved for residents to assist with temporary

40,000 people visited local disaster recovery centers designed to provide additional information regarding the aftermath of the hurricane 69 70 71 72 73 in north carolina hundreds of residents were stranded in hatteras following the formation of isabel inlet 74 people who were not residents were not allowed to be on the outer banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions when visitors were allowed to return many ventured to see the new inlet despite a 1-mile 1.6-km walk from the nearest road 37 initially long term solutions to the isabel inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered though they were ultimately canceled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet coastal geologists were opposed to the solution stating the evolution of the outer banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes 75 dredging operations began on october 17 about a month after the hurricane struck the united states geological survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of hatteras island a choice made to minimize the impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane 76 on november 22 about two months after the hurricane struck north carolina highway 12 and hatteras island were reopened to public access on the same day the ferry between hatteras and ocracoke was reopened 37 in west virginia the power outages were restored within a week 77 power workers throughout canada assisted the severely affected power companies from maryland to north carolina 78 hydro-québec sent 25 teams to the new york city area to assist in power outages 79 retirement edit because of widespread property damage and extensive death tolls the name isabel was retired after the 2003 season and will not be used for future atlantic hurricanes it was replaced by ida for the naming list for the 2009 season 80 the names ina and ivy were also suggested as possible replacement names 81

rotates about its axis about 366.26 times n 5 earth s axis of rotation is tilted producing seasonal variations on the planet s surface 27 the gravitational interaction between the earth and moon causes ocean tides stabilizes the earth s orientation on its axis and gradually slows its rotation 28 earth is the densest planet in the solar system and the largest of the four terrestrial planets earth s lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years about 71 of earth s surface is covered with water mostly by its oceans 29 the remaining 29 is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere the majority of earth s polar regions are covered in ice including the antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the arctic ice pack earth s interior remains active with a solid iron inner core a liquid outer core that generates the earth s magnetic field and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics within the first billion years of earth s history life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the earth s atmosphere and surface leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago since then the combination of earth s distance from the sun physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive 30 31 in the history of the earth biodiversity has gone through long periods of

most species have not been described 38 over 7.4 billion humans live on earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival humans have developed diverse societies and cultures politically the world has about 200 sovereign states name and etymology the modern english word earth developed from a wide variety of middle english forms n 6 which derived from an old english noun most often spelled eorðe 39 it has cognates in every germanic language and their proto-germanic root has been reconstructed as erþō in its earliest appearances eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of latin terra and greek γῆ gē the ground n 7 its soil n 8 dry land n 9 the human world n 10 the surface of the world including the sea n 11 and the globe itself n 12 as with terra and gaia earth was a personified goddess in germanic paganism the angles were listed by tacitus as among the devotees of nerthus 48 and later norse mythology included jörð a giantess often given as the mother of thor 49 originally earth was written in lowercase and from early middle english its definite sense as the globe was expressed as the earth by early modern english many nouns were capitalized and the earth became and often remained the earth particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies more recently the name is sometimes simply given as earth by analogy with the names of the other planets 39 house styles now vary oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common with the capitalized form an acceptable variant another convention capitalizes earth when appearing as a name e.g earth s atmosphere but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the e.g the atmosphere of the earth it almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as what on earth are you doing 50 chronology main article history of earth formation artist s impression of the early solar system s planetary disk the oldest material found in the solar system

earth s interior like that of the other terrestrial planets is divided into layers by their chemical or physical rheological properties the outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle the crust is separated from the mantle by the mohorovičić discontinuity the thickness of the crust varies from about 7003600000000000000♠6 km kilometers under the oceans to 30–50 km for the continents the crust and the cold rigid top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410

comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion about 20 and heat produced through radioactive decay 80 106 the major heat-producing isotopes within earth are potassium-40 uranium-238 and thorium-232 107 at the center the temperature may be up to 6,000 °c 10,830 °f 108 and the pressure could reach 360 gpa 109 because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay scientists postulate that early in earth s history before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted earth s heat production was much higher at approximately 7016946728000000000♠3 ga twice the present-day heat would have been produced increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed

consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock these plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts 113 more of the heat in earth is lost through plate tectonics by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges the final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents 114 tectonic plates earth s major plates 115 plate name area 106 km2   pacific plate 103.3   african plate n 16 78.0   north american plate 75.9   eurasian plate 67.8   antarctic plate

these plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries convergent boundaries at which two plates come together divergent boundaries at which two plates are pulled apart and transform boundaries in which two plates slide past one another laterally earthquakes volcanic activity mountain-building and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries 116 the tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates 117 as the tectonic plates migrate oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries at the same time the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges the combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle due to this recycling most of the ocean floor is less than 7015315576000000000♠100 ma old in age the oldest oceanic crust

oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms 141 sea water has an important influence on the world s climate with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir 142 shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts such as the el niño-southern oscillation 143 atmosphere main article atmosphere of earth satellite image of earth cloud cover using nasa s moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer the atmospheric pressure on earth s surface averages 101.325 kpa with a scale height of about 8.5 km 3 it has a composition of 78 nitrogen and 21 oxygen with trace amounts of water vapor carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules the height of the troposphere varies with latitude ranging between 8 km at the poles to 17 km at the equator with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors 144 earth s biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 7000270000000000000♠2.7 gya forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today 71 this change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and indirectly the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric o2 into o3 the ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation permitting life on land 145 other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor providing useful gases causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface and moderating temperature 146 this last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground thereby raising the average temperature water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere without this heat-retention effect the average surface temperature would be −18 °c in contrast to the current 15 °c 147 and life on earth probably would not exist in its current form 148 in may 2017 glints of light seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere 149 150 weather and climate main articles weather and climate hurricane felix seen from low earth orbit september 2007 lenticular cloud with a pressure ridge near mount discovery antarctica november 2013 massive clouds above the mojave desert february 2016 earth s atmosphere has no definite boundary slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space three-quarters of the atmosphere s mass is contained within the first 11 km 6.8 mi of the surface this lowest layer is called the troposphere energy from the sun heats this layer and the surface below causing expansion of the air this lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler higher-density air the result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy 151 the primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60° 152 ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions 153 water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere when atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm humid air this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation 151 most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes this water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods precipitation patterns vary widely ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter atmospheric circulation topographic features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region 154 the amount of solar energy reaching earth s surface decreases with increasing latitude at higher latitudes the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere as a result the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °c 0.7 °f per degree of latitude from the equator 155 earth s surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate ranging from the equator to the polar regions these are the tropical or equatorial subtropical temperate and polar climates 156 this latitudinal rule has several anomalies proximity to oceans moderates the climate for example the scandinavian peninsula has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of northern canada the wind enables this moderating effect the windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side in the northern hemisphere the prevailing wind is west-to-east and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts this is seen in eastern north america and western europe where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean 157 in the southern hemisphere the prevailing wind is east-to-west and the eastern coasts are milder the distance from the earth to the sun varies the earth is closest to the sun at perihelion in january which is summer in the southern hemisphere it is furthest away at aphelion in july which is summer in the northern hemisphere and only 93.55 of the solar radiation from the sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion despite this there are larger land masses in the northern hemisphere which are easier to heat than the seas consequently summers are 2.3 °c 4 °f warmer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere under similar conditions 158 the climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density the commonly used köppen climate classification system has five broad groups humid tropics arid humid middle latitudes continental and cold polar which are further divided into more specific subtypes 152 the köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation the highest air temperature ever measured on earth was 56.7 °c 134.1 °f in furnace creek california in death valley in 1913 159 the lowest air temperature ever directly measured on earth was −89.2 °c −128.6 °f at vostok station in 1983 160 but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as −94.7 °c −138.5 °f in east antarctica 161 these temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on earth upper atmosphere this view from orbit shows the full moon partially obscured by earth s atmosphere above the troposphere the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere mesosphere and thermosphere 146 each layer has a different lapse rate defining the rate of change in temperature with height beyond these the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind 162 within the stratosphere is the ozone layer a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on earth the kármán line defined as 100 km above earth s surface is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space 163 thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from earth s gravity this causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases 164 the leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of earth s atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere 165 hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on earth 166 in the current oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape instead most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere 167 gravitational field main article gravity of earth earth s gravity measured by nasa s grace mission showing deviations from the theoretical gravity red shows where gravity is stronger than the smooth standard value and blue shows where it is weaker the gravity of earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the earth near the earth s surface gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m s2 32 ft s2 local differences in topography geology and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in the earth s gravitational field known as gravitational anomalies 168 magnetic field main article earth s magnetic field the main part of earth s magnetic field is generated in the core the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy the field extends outwards from the core through the mantle and up to earth s surface where it is approximately a dipole the poles of the dipole are located close to earth s geographic poles at the equator of the magnetic field the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05 × 10−5 t with global magnetic dipole moment of 7.91 × 1015 t m3 169 the convection movements in the core are chaotic the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment this causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years the most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago 170 171 magnetosphere main article magnetosphere schematic of earth s magnetosphere the solar wind flows from left to right the extent of earth s magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere to about 10 earth radii and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail 172 because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which wave propagate through the solar wind a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind 173 charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as earth rotates 174 175 the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field 176 and the van allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere 172 177 during magnetic storms and substorms charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail directed along field lines into earth s ionosphere where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized causing the aurora 178 orbit and rotation rotation main article earth s rotation earth s rotation imaged by dscovr epic on 29 may 2016 a few weeks before the solstice earth s rotation period relative to the sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time 86,400.0025 si seconds 179 because earth s solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration each day varies between 0 and 2 si ms longer 180 181 earth s rotation period relative to the fixed stars called its stellar day by the international earth rotation and reference systems service iers is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time ut1 or 23h 56m 4.0989s 2 n 18 earth s rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox misnamed its sidereal day is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time ut1 23h 56m 4.0905s 2 thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms 182 the length of the mean solar day in si seconds is available from the iers for the periods 1623–2005 183 and 1962–2005 184 apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in earth s sky is to the west at a rate of 15° h 15 min for bodies near the celestial equator this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the sun or the moon every two minutes from earth s surface the apparent sizes of the sun and the moon are approximately the same 185 186 orbit main article earth s orbit the pale blue dot photo taken in 1990 by the voyager 1 spacecraft showing earth center right from nearly 6.4 billion km 4 billion mi away earth orbits the sun at an average distance of about 150 million km 93 million mi every 365.2564 mean solar days or one sidereal year this gives an apparent movement of the sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1° day which is one apparent sun or moon diameter every 12 hours due to this motion on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the sun returns to the meridian the orbital speed of earth averages about 29.78 km s 107,200 km h 66,600 mph which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to earth s diameter about 12,742 km 7,918 mi in seven minutes and the distance to the moon 384,000 km 239,000 mi in about 3.5 hours 3 the moon and earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars when combined with the earth–moon system s common orbit around the sun the period of the synodic month from new moon to new moon is 29.53 days viewed from the celestial north pole the motion of earth the moon and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the sun and earth earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the sun the orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned earth s axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the earth–sun plane the ecliptic and the earth–moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the earth–sun plane without this tilt there would be an eclipse every two weeks alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses 3 187 the hill sphere or the sphere of gravitational influence of the earth is about 1.5 million kilometres 930,000 mi in radius 188 n 19 this is the maximum distance at which the earth s gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant sun and planets objects must orbit the earth within this radius or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the sun earth along with the solar system is situated in the milky way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center it is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the orion arm 189 axial tilt and seasons main article axial tilt § earth earth s axial tilt or obliquity and its relation to the rotation axis and plane of orbit the axial tilt of the earth is approximately 23.439281° 2 with the axis of its orbit plane always pointing towards the celestial poles due to earth s axial tilt the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year this causes the seasonal change in climate with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when the tropic of cancer is facing the sun and winter taking place when the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere faces the sun during the summer the day lasts longer and the sun climbs higher in the sky in winter the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter in northern temperate latitudes the sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice and sets north of true west reversing in the winter the sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west above the arctic circle an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year up to six months at the north pole itself a polar night in the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly reversed with the south pole oriented opposite the direction of the north pole six months later this pole will experience a midnight sun a day of 24 hours again reversing with the south pole by astronomical convention the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the sun—and the equinoxes when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the sun are perpendicular in the northern hemisphere winter solstice currently occurs around 21 december summer solstice is near 21 june spring equinox is around 20 march and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 september in the southern hemisphere the situation is reversed with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped 190 the angle of earth s axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time its axial tilt does undergo nutation a slight irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years 191 the orientation rather than the angle of earth s axis also changes over time precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800 year cycle this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the sun and the moon on earth s equatorial bulge the poles also migrate a few meters across earth s surface this polar motion has multiple cyclical components which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion in addition to an annual component to this motion there is a 14-month cycle called the chandler wobble earth s rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation 192 in modern times earth s perihelion occurs around 3 january and its aphelion around 4 july these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles the changing earth–sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9 n 20 in solar energy reaching earth at perihelion relative to aphelion because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun at about the same time that earth reaches the closest approach to the sun the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the sun than does the northern over the course of a year this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere 193 habitability the rocky mountains in canada overlook moraine lake a planet that can sustain life is termed habitable even if life did not originate there earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism 194 the distance of earth from the sun as well as its orbital eccentricity rate of rotation axial tilt geological history sustaining atmosphere and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface 195 biosphere main article biosphere a planet s life forms inhabit ecosystems whose total is sometimes said to form a biosphere earth s biosphere is thought to have begun evolving about 7000350000000000000♠3.5 gya 71 the biosphere is divided into a number of biomes inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals on land biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude height above sea level and humidity terrestrial biomes lying within the arctic or antarctic circles at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes 196 in july 2016 scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor luca of all organisms

only renew over geological timescales large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from earth s crust consisting of coal petroleum and natural gas these deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis resulting from actions of magmatism erosion and plate tectonics 199 these bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements earth s biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans including food wood pharmaceuticals oxygen and the recycling of many organic wastes the land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land 200

croplands 201 the estimated amount of irrigated land in 1993 was 2,481,250 square kilometres 958,020 sq mi 14 humans also live on the land by using building materials to construct shelters natural and environmental hazards a volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere large areas of earth s surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical cyclones hurricanes or typhoons that dominate life in those areas from 1980 to 2000 these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year 202 many places are subject to earthquakes landslides tsunamis volcanic eruptions tornadoes sinkholes blizzards floods droughts wildfires and other calamities and disasters many localized areas are subject to human-made pollution of the air and water acid rain and toxic substances loss of vegetation overgrazing deforestation desertification loss of wildlife species extinction soil degradation soil depletion and erosion there is a scientific consensus linking human activities to global warming due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions this is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets more extreme temperature ranges significant changes in weather and a global

united nations is a worldwide intergovernmental organization that was created with the goal of intervening in the disputes between nations thereby avoiding armed conflict 212 the u.n serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law when the consensus of the membership permits it provides a mechanism for armed intervention 213 the first human to orbit earth was yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961 214 in total about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of 30 july 2010 update and of these twelve have walked on the moon 215 216 217 normally the only humans in space are those on the international space station the station s crew made up of six people is usually replaced every six months 218 the farthest that humans have traveled from earth is

moon is a relatively large terrestrial planet-like natural satellite with a diameter about one-quarter of earth s it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet although charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto the natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as moons after earth s the gravitational attraction between earth and the moon causes tides on earth the same effect on the moon has led to its tidal locking its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit earth as a result it always presents the same face to the planet as the moon orbits earth different parts of its face are illuminated by the sun leading to the lunar phases the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator details of the earth–moon system showing the radius of each object and the earth–moon barycenter the moon s axis is located by cassini s third law due to their tidal interaction the moon recedes from earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm yr over millions of years these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of earth s day by about 23 µs yr—add up to significant changes 220 during the devonian period for example approximately 7002410000000000000♠410 mya there were 400 days in a year with each day lasting 21.8 hours 221 the moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet s climate paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that earth s axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the moon 28 some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the sun and planets to earth s equatorial bulge the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years as appears to be the case for mars 222 viewed from earth the moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the sun the angular size or solid angle of these two bodies match because although the sun s diameter is about 400 times as large as the moon s it is also 400 times more distant 186 this allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on earth the most widely accepted theory of the moon s origin the giant-impact hypothesis states that it formed from the collision of a mars-size protoplanet called theia with the early earth this hypothesis explains among other things the moon s relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of earth s crust 223 asteroids and artificial satellites earth has at least five co-orbital asteroids including 3753 cruithne and 2002 aa29 224 225 a trojan asteroid companion 2010 tk7 is librating around the leading lagrange triangular point l4 in the earth s orbit

of time 228 as of june 2016 update there were 1,419 operational human-made satellites orbiting earth 5 there are also inoperative satellites including vanguard 1 the oldest satellite currently in orbit and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris n 3 earth s largest artificial satellite is the international space station cultural and historical viewpoint main article earth in culture earthrise taken by astronauts on board apollo 8 the standard astronomical symbol of earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle 229 representing the four corners of the world human cultures have developed many views of the planet earth is sometimes personified as a deity in many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity 230 and by the mid-20th century the gaia principle compared earth s environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability 231 232 233 creation myths in many religions involve the creation of earth by a supernatural deity or deities 230 scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people s view of the planet in the west belief in a flat earth 234 was displaced by the idea of spherical earth credited to pythagoras in the 6th century bc 235 earth was further believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object comparable to the other planets in the solar system 236 due to the efforts of influential christian scholars and clerics such as james ussher who sought to determine the age of earth through analysis of genealogies in scripture westerners before the 19th century generally believed earth to be a few thousand years old at most it was only during the 19th century that geologists realized earth s age was at least many millions of years 237 lord kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864 sparking a vigorous debate on the subject it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining earth s age was established proving the planet to be billions of years old 238 239 the perception of earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit and especially with photographs of earth returned by the apollo program 240

polluted the air is see air quality index for the properties of air see qualities of air air pollution from a coking oven air pollution occurs when harmful substances including particulates and biological molecules are introduced into earth s atmosphere it may cause diseases allergies or death of humans it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops and may damage the natural or built environment human activity and natural processes can both generate air pollution indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 blacksmith institute world s worst polluted places report 1 according to the 2014 world health organization report air pollution in 2012 caused the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide 2 an estimate roughly matched by the international energy agency 3 4 part of the nature series weather calendar seasons winter spring summer autumn tropical seasons

forecasting weather portal v t e pollutants edit main articles pollutant and greenhouse gas an air pollutant is a substance in the air that can have adverse effects on humans and the ecosystem the substance can be solid particles liquid droplets or gases a pollutant can be of natural origin or man-made pollutants are classified as primary or secondary primary pollutants are usually produced from a process such as ash from a volcanic eruption other examples include carbon monoxide gas from motor vehicle exhaust or the sulfur dioxide released from factories secondary pollutants are not emitted directly rather they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact ground level ozone is a prominent example of a secondary pollutant some pollutants may be both primary and secondary they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants before flue-gas desulfurization was installed the emissions from this power plant in new mexico contained excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide schematic drawing causes and effects of air pollution 1 greenhouse effect 2 particulate contamination 3 increased uv radiation 4 acid rain 5 increased ground level ozone concentration 6 increased levels of nitrogen oxides thermal oxidizers are air pollution abatement options for hazardous air pollutants haps volatile organic compounds vocs and odorous emissions substances emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include carbon dioxide co2 because of its role as a greenhouse gas it has been described as the leading pollutant 5 and the worst climate pollution 6 carbon dioxide is a natural component of the atmosphere essential for plant life and given off by the human respiratory system 7 this question of terminology has practical effects for example as determining whether the u.s clean air act is deemed to regulate co2 emissions 8 co2 currently forms about 405 parts per million ppm of earth s atmosphere compared to about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times 9 and billions of metric tons of co2 are emitted annually by burning of fossil fuels 10 co2 increase in earth s atmosphere has been accelerating 11 sulfur oxides sox particularly sulfur dioxide a chemical compound with the formula so2 so2 is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial processes coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds and their combustion generates sulfur dioxide further oxidation of so2 usually in the presence of a catalyst such as no2 forms h2so4 and thus acid rain 2 this is one of the causes for concern over the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources nitrogen oxides nox nitrogen oxides particularly nitrogen dioxide are expelled from high temperature combustion and are also produced during thunderstorms by electric discharge they can be seen as a brown haze dome above or a plume downwind of cities nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula no2 it is one of several nitrogen oxides one of the most prominent air pollutants this reddish-brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp biting odor carbon monoxide co co is a colorless odorless toxic yet non-irritating gas it is a product of incomplete combustion of fuel such as natural gas coal or wood vehicular exhaust is a major source of carbon monoxide volatile organic compounds voc vocs are a well-known outdoor air pollutant they are categorized as either methane ch4 or non-methane nmvocs methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global warming other hydrocarbon vocs are also significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere this effect varies depending on local air quality the aromatic nmvocs benzene toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged exposure 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated with industrial use particulates alternatively referred to as particulate matter pm atmospheric particulate matter or fine particles are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas in contrast aerosol refers to combined particles and gas some particulates occur naturally originating from volcanoes dust storms forest and grassland fires living vegetation and sea spray human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles power plants and various industrial processes also generate significant amounts of aerosols averaged worldwide anthropogenic aerosols—those made by human activities—currently account for approximately 10 percent of our atmosphere increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease 12 altered lung function and lung cancer persistent free radicals connected to airborne fine particles are linked to cardiopulmonary disease 13 14 toxic metals such as lead and mercury especially their compounds chlorofluorocarbons cfcs harmful to the ozone layer emitted from products are currently banned from use these are gases which are released from air conditioners refrigerators aerosol sprays etc on release into the air cfcs rise to the stratosphere here they come in contact with other gases and damage the ozone layer this allows harmful ultraviolet rays to reach the earth s surface this can lead to skin cancer eye disease and can even cause damage to plants ammonia nh3 emitted from agricultural processes ammonia is a compound with the formula nh3 it is normally encountered as a gas with a characteristic pungent odor ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to foodstuffs and fertilizers ammonia either directly or indirectly is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals although in wide use ammonia is both caustic and hazardous in the atmosphere ammonia reacts with oxides of nitrogen and sulfur to form secondary particles 15 odours — such as from garbage sewage and industrial processes radioactive pollutants produced by nuclear explosions nuclear events war explosives and natural processes such as the radioactive decay of radon secondary pollutants include particulates created from gaseous primary pollutants and compounds in photochemical smog smog is a kind of air pollution classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of smoke and sulfur dioxide modern smog does not usually come from coal but from vehicular and industrial emissions that are acted on in the atmosphere by ultraviolet light from the sun to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog ground level ozone o3 formed from nox and vocs ozone o3 is a key constituent of the troposphere it is also an important constituent of certain regions of the stratosphere commonly known as the ozone layer photochemical and chemical reactions involving it drive many of the chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere by day and by night at abnormally high concentrations brought about by human activities largely the combustion of fossil fuel it is a pollutant and a constituent of smog peroxyacetyl nitrate c2h3no5 similarly formed from nox and vocs minor air pollutants include a large number of minor hazardous air pollutants some of these are regulated in usa under the clean air act and in europe under the air framework directive a variety of persistent organic pollutants which can attach to particulates persistent organic pollutants pops are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical biological and photolytic processes because of this they have been observed to persist in the environment to be capable of long-range transport bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue biomagnify in food chains and to have potentially significant impacts on human health and the environment sources edit play media this video provides an overview of a nasa study on the human fingerprint on global air quality there are various locations activities or factors which are responsible for releasing pollutants into the atmosphere these sources can be classified into two major categories anthropogenic man-made sources controlled burning of a field outside of statesboro georgia in preparation for spring planting these are mostly related to the burning of multiple types of fuel stationary sources include smoke stacks of power plants manufacturing facilities factories and waste incinerators as well as furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices in developing and poor countries traditional biomass burning is the major source of air pollutants traditional biomass includes wood crop waste and dung 16 17 mobile sources include motor vehicles marine vessels and aircraft controlled burn practices in agriculture and forest management controlled or prescribed burning is a technique sometimes used in forest management farming prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement fire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be a tool for foresters controlled burning stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees thus renewing the forest fumes from paint hair spray varnish aerosol sprays and other solvents waste deposition in landfills which generate methane methane is highly flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space asphyxia or suffocation may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below 19.5 by displacement military resources such as nuclear weapons toxic gases germ warfare and rocketry natural sources dust storm approaching stratford texas dust from natural sources usually large areas of land with little or no vegetation methane emitted by the digestion of food by animals for example cattle radon gas from radioactive decay within the earth s crust radon is a colorless odorless naturally occurring radioactive noble gas that is formed from the decay of radium it is considered to be a health hazard radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings especially in confined areas such as the basement and it is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking smoke and carbon monoxide from wildfires vegetation in some regions emits environmentally significant amounts of volatile organic compounds vocs on warmer days these vocs react with primary anthropogenic pollutants—specifically nox so2 and anthropogenic organic carbon compounds — to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants 18 black gum poplar oak and willow are some examples of vegetation that can produce abundant vocs the voc production from these species result in ozone levels up to eight times higher than the low-impact tree species 19 volcanic activity which produces sulfur chlorine and ash particulates emission factors edit main article ap 42 compilation of air pollutant emission factors beijing air on a 2005-day after rain left and a smoggy day right air pollutant emission factors are reported representative values that attempt to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated with the release of that pollutant these factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight volume distance or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant e.g. kilograms of particulate emitted per tonne of coal burned such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution in most cases these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages there are 12 compounds in the list of persistent organic pollutants dioxins and furans are two of them and intentionally created by combustion of organics like open burning of plastics these compounds are also endocrine disruptors and can mutate the human genes the united states environmental protection agency has published a compilation of air pollutant emission factors for a wide range of industrial sources 20 the united kingdom australia canada and many other countries have published similar compilations as well as the european environment agency 21 22 23 24 exposure edit air pollution risk is a function of the hazard of the pollutant and the exposure to that pollutant air pollution exposure can be expressed for an individual for certain groups e.g neighborhoods or children living in a country or for entire populations for example one may want to calculate the exposure to a hazardous air pollutant for a geographic area which includes the various microenvironments and age groups this can be calculated 25 as an inhalation exposure this would account for daily exposure in various settings e.g different indoor micro-environments and outdoor locations the exposure needs to include different age and other demographic groups especially infants children pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations the exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air pollutant with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities playing cooking reading working etc for example a small child s inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult a child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary activity the daily exposure then needs to reflect the time spent in each micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings the air pollutant concentration in each microactivity microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure 25 indoor air quality iaq edit main article indoor air quality air quality monitoring new delhi india a lack of ventilation indoors concentrates air pollution where people often spend the majority of their time radon rn gas a carcinogen is exuded from the earth in certain locations and trapped inside houses building materials including carpeting and plywood emit formaldehyde h2co gas paint and solvents give off volatile organic compounds vocs as they dry lead paint can degenerate into dust and be inhaled intentional air pollution is introduced with the use of air fresheners incense and other scented items controlled wood fires in stoves and fireplaces can add significant amounts of smoke particulates into the air inside and out 26 indoor pollution fatalities may be caused by using pesticides and other chemical sprays indoors without proper ventilation carbon monoxide poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and chimneys or by the burning of charcoal indoors or in a confined space such as a tent 27 chronic carbon monoxide poisoning can result even from poorly-adjusted pilot lights traps are built into all domestic plumbing to keep sewer gas and hydrogen sulfide out of interiors clothing emits tetrachloroethylene or other dry cleaning fluids for days after dry cleaning though its use has now been banned in many countries the extensive use of asbestos in industrial and domestic environments in the past has left a potentially very dangerous material in many localities asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory medical condition affecting the tissue of the lungs it occurs after long-term heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos-containing materials in structures sufferers have severe dyspnea shortness of breath and are at an increased risk regarding several different types of lung cancer as clear explanations are not always stressed in non-technical literature care should be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases according to the world health organisation who these may defined as asbestosis lung cancer and peritoneal mesothelioma generally a very rare form of cancer when more widespread it is almost always associated with prolonged exposure to asbestos biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors as gases and airborne particulates pets produce dander people produce dust from minute skin flakes and decomposed hair dust mites in bedding carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre-sized fecal droppings inhabitants emit methane mold forms on walls and generates mycotoxins and spores air conditioning systems can incubate legionnaires disease and mold and houseplants soil and surrounding gardens can produce pollen dust and mold indoors the lack of air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they would otherwise occur in nature health effects edit see also neuroplastic effects of pollution air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases and health conditions including respiratory infections heart disease copd stroke and lung cancer 2 the health effects caused by air pollution may include difficulty in breathing wheezing coughing asthma and worsening of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions these effects can result in increased medication use increased doctor or emergency room visits more hospital admissions and premature death the human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching but principally affect the body s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to the degree of exposure and the individual s health status and genetics 25 the most common sources of air pollution include particulates ozone nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide children aged less than five years that live in developing countries are the most vulnerable population in terms of total deaths attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution 28 mortality edit the world health organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide 2 india has the highest death rate due to air pollution 29 india also has more deaths from asthma than any other nation according to the world health organization in december 2013 air pollution was estimated to kill 500,000 people in china each year 30 there is a positive correlation between pneumonia-related deaths and air pollution from motor vehicle emissions 31 annual premature european deaths caused by air pollution are estimated at 430,000 32 an important cause of these deaths is nitrogen dioxide and other nitrogen oxides nox emitted by road vehicles 32 in a 2015 consultation document the uk government disclosed that nitrogen dioxide is responsible for 23,500 premature uk deaths per annum 33 across the european union air pollution is estimated to reduce life expectancy by almost nine months 34 causes of deaths include strokes heart disease copd lung cancer and lung infections 2 urban outdoor air pollution is estimated to cause 1.3 million deaths worldwide per year children are particularly at risk due to the immaturity of their respiratory organ systems 35 the us epa estimates that a proposed set of changes in diesel engine technology tier 2 could result in 12,000 fewer premature mortalities 15,000 fewer heart attacks 6,000 fewer emergency room visits by children with asthma and 8,900 fewer respiratory-related hospital admissions each year in the united states 36 the us epa has estimated that limiting ground-level ozone concentration to 65 parts per billion would avert 1,700 to 5,100 premature deaths nationwide in 2020 compared with the 75-ppb standard the agency projected the more protective standard would also prevent an additional 26,000 cases of aggravated asthma and more than a million cases of missed work or school 37 38 following this assessment the epa acted to protect public health by lowering the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion ppb 39 a new economic study of the health impacts and associated costs of air pollution in the los angeles basin and san joaquin valley of southern california shows that more than 3,800 people die prematurely approximately 14 years earlier than normal each year because air pollution levels violate federal standards the number of annual premature deaths is considerably higher than the fatalities related to auto collisions in the same area which average fewer than 2,000 per year 40 41 42 diesel exhaust de is a major contributor to combustion-derived particulate matter air pollution in several human experimental studies using a well-validated exposure chamber setup de has been linked to acute vascular dysfunction and increased thrombus formation 43 44 the mechanisms linking air pollution to increased cardiovascular mortality are uncertain but probably include pulmonary and systemic inflammation 45 cardiovascular disease edit a 2007 review of evidence found ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor correlating with increased total mortality from cardiovascular events range 12 to 14 per 10 microg m3 increase 46 air pollution is also emerging as a risk factor for stroke particularly in developing countries where pollutant levels are highest 47 a 2007 study found that in women air pollution is not associated with hemorrhagic but with ischemic stroke 48 air pollution was also found to be associated with increased incidence and mortality from coronary stroke in a cohort study in 2011 49 associations are believed to be causal and effects may be mediated by vasoconstriction low-grade inflammation and atherosclerosis 50 other mechanisms such as autonomic nervous system imbalance have also been suggested 51 52 lung disease edit research has demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma 53 and copd 54 from increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution additionally air pollution has been associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from asthma and copd 55 56 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd includes diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema 57 a study conducted in 1960-1961 in the wake of the great smog of 1952 compared 293 london residents with 477 residents of gloucester peterborough and norwich three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis all subjects were male postal truck drivers aged 40 to 59 compared to the subjects from the outlying towns the london subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms including cough phlegm and dyspnea reduced lung function fev1 and peak flow rate and increased sputum production and purulence the differences were more pronounced for subjects aged 50 to 59 the study controlled for age and smoking habits so concluded that air pollution was the most likely cause of the observed differences 58 more recent studies have shown that air pollution exposure from traffic reduces lung function development in children 59 and lung function may be compromised by air pollution even at low concentrations 60 air pollution exposure also cause lung cancer in non smokers it is believed that much like cystic fibrosis by living in a more urban environment serious health hazards become more apparent studies have shown that in urban areas patients suffer mucus hypersecretion lower levels of lung function and more self-diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema 61 cancer edit cancer mainly the result of environmental factors 62 a review of evidence regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor for cancer in 2007 found solid data to conclude that long-term exposure to pm2.5 fine particulates increases the overall risk of non-accidental mortality by 6 per a 10 microg m3 increase exposure to pm2.5 was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung cancer range 15 to 21 per 10 microg m3 increase and total cardiovascular mortality range 12 to 14 per a 10 microg m3 increase the review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes - increase in lung cancer deaths cardiovascular deaths and overall non-accidental deaths the reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to pm2.5 is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to so2 increases mortality from lung cancer but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions 63 another investigation showed that higher activity level increases deposition fraction of aerosol particles in human lung and recommended avoiding heavy activities like running in outdoor space at polluted areas 64 in 2011 a large danish epidemiological study found an increased risk of lung cancer for patients who lived in areas with high nitrogen oxide concentrations in this study the association was higher for non-smokers than smokers 65 an additional danish study also in 2011 likewise noted evidence of possible associations between air pollution and other forms of cancer including cervical cancer and brain cancer 66 in december 2015 medical scientists reported that cancer is overwhelmingly a result of environmental factors and not largely down to bad luck 62 maintaining a healthy weight eating a healthy diet minimizing alcohol and eliminating smoking reduces the risk of developing the disease according to the researchers 62 children edit in the united states despite the passage of the clean air act in 1970 in 2002 at least 146 million americans were living in non-attainment areas—regions in which the concentration of certain air pollutants exceeded federal standards 67 these dangerous pollutants are known as the criteria pollutants and include ozone particulate matter sulfur dioxide nitrogen dioxide carbon monoxide and lead protective measures to ensure children s health are being taken in cities such as new delhi india where buses now use compressed natural gas to help eliminate the pea-soup smog 68 a recent study in europe has found that exposure to ultrafine particles can increase blood pressure in children 69 infants edit ambient levels of air pollution have been associated with preterm birth and low birth weight a 2014 who worldwide survey on maternal and perinatal health found a statistically significant association between low birth weights lbw and increased levels of exposure to pm2.5 women in regions with greater than average pm2.5 levels had statistically significant higher odds of pregnancy resulting in a low-birth weight infant even when adjusted for country-related variables 70 the effect is thought to be from stimulating inflammation and increasing oxidative stress a study by the university of york found that in 2010 exposure to pm2.5 was strongly associated with 18 of preterm births globally which was approximately 2.7 million premature births the countries with the highest air pollution associated preterm births were in south and east asia the middle east north africa and west sub-saharan africa 71 the source of pm 2.5 differs greatly by region in south and east asia pregnant women are frequently exposed to indoor air pollution because of the wood and other biomass fuels used for cooking which are responsible for more than 80 of regional pollution in the middle east north africa and west sub-saharan africa fine pm comes from natural sources such as dust storms 71 the united states had an estimated 50,000 preterm births associated with exposure to pm2.5 in 2010 71 a study performed by wang et al between the years of 1988 and 1991 has found a correlation between sulfur dioxide so2 and total suspended particulates tsp and preterm births and low birth weights in beijing a group of 74,671 pregnant women in four separate regions of beijing were monitored from early pregnancy to delivery along with daily air pollution levels of sulfur dioxide and tsp along with other particulates the estimated reduction in birth weight was 7.3 g for every 100 µg m3 increase in so2 and 6.9g for each 100 µg m3 increase in tsp these associations were statistically significant in both summer and winter although summer was greater the proportion of low birth weight attributable to air pollution was 13 this is the largest attributable risk ever reported for the known risk factors of low birth weight 72 coal stoves which are in 97 of homes are a major source of air pollution in this area brauer et al studied the relationship between air pollution and proximity to a highway with pregnancy outcomes in a vancouver cohort of pregnant woman using addresses to estimate exposure during pregnancy exposure to no no2 co pm10 and pm2.5 were associated with infants born small for gestational age sga women living 50meters away from an expressway or highway were 26 more likely to give birth to a sga infant 73 clean areas edit even in the areas with relatively low levels of air pollution public health effects can be significant and costly since a large number of people breathe in such pollutants a 2005 scientific study for the british columbia lung association showed that a small improvement in air quality 1 reduction of ambient pm2.5 and ozone concentrations would produce 29 million in annual savings in the metro vancouver region in 2010 74 this finding is based on health valuation of lethal death and sub-lethal illness affects central nervous system edit data is accumulating that air pollution exposure also affects the central nervous system 75 in a june 2014 study conducted by researchers at the university of rochester medical center published in the journal environmental health perspectives it was discovered that early exposure to air pollution causes the same damaging changes in the brain as autism and schizophrenia the study also shows that air pollution also affected short-term memory learning ability and impulsivity lead researcher professor deborah cory-slechta said that when we looked closely at the ventricles we could see that the white matter that normally surrounds them hadn t fully developed it appears that inflammation had damaged those brain cells and prevented that region of the brain from developing and the ventricles simply expanded to fill the space our findings add to the growing body of evidence that air pollution may play a role in autism as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders air pollution has a more significant negative effect on males than on females 76 77 78 in 2015 experimental studies reported the detection of significant episodic situational cognitive impairment from impurities in indoor air breathed by test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality researchers at the harvard university and suny upstate medical university and syracuse university measured the cognitive performance of 24 participants in three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in conventional and green buildings as well as green buildings with enhanced ventilation performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used strategic management simulation software simulation tool which is a well-validated assessment test for executive decision-making in an unconstrained situation allowing initiative and improvisation significant deficits were observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of either volatile organic compounds vocs or carbon dioxide while keeping other factors constant the highest impurity levels reached are not uncommon in some classroom or office environments 79 80 agricultural effects edit in india in 2014 it was reported that air pollution by black carbon and ground level ozone had cut crop yields in the most affected areas by almost half in 2010 when compared to 1980 levels 81 economic effects edit air pollution costs the world economy 5 trillion per year as a result of productivity losses and degraded quality of life according to a joint study by the world bank and the institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme at the university of washington 82 83 these productivity losses are caused by deaths due to diseases caused by air pollution one out of ten deaths in 2013 was caused by diseases associated with air pollution and the problem is getting worse the problem is even more acute in the developing world children under age 5 in lower-income countries are more than 60 times as likely to die from exposure to air pollution as children in high-income countries 82 83 the report states that additional economic losses caused by air pollution including health costs and the adverse effect on agricultural and other productivity were not calculated in the report and thus the actual costs to the world economy are far higher than 5 trillion historical disasters edit the world s worst short-term civilian pollution crisis was the 1984 bhopal disaster in india 84 leaked industrial vapours from the union carbide factory belonging to union carbide inc. u.s.a later bought by dow chemical company killed at least 3787 people and injured from 150,000 to 600,000 the united kingdom suffered its worst air pollution event when the december 4 great smog of 1952 formed over london in six days more than 4,000 died and more recent estimates put the figure at nearer 12,000 85 an accidental leak of anthrax spores from a biological warfare laboratory in the former ussr in 1979 near sverdlovsk is believed to have caused at least 64 deaths 86 the worst single incident of air pollution to occur in the us occurred in donora pennsylvania in late october 1948 when 20 people died and over 7,000 were injured 87 alternatives to pollution edit there are now practical alternatives to the principal causes of air pollution areas downwind over 20 miles of major airports more than double total particulate emissions in air even when factoring in areas with frequent ship calls and heavy freeway and city traffic like los angeles 88 aviation biofuel mixed in with jetfuel at a 50 50 ratio can reduce jet derived cruise altitude particulate emissions by 50-70 according to a nasa led 2017 study however this should imply ground level benefits to urban air pollution as well 89 ship propulsion and idling can be switched to much cleaner fuels like natural gas ideally a renewable source but not practical yet combustion of fossil fuels for space heating can be replaced by using ground source heat pumps and seasonal thermal energy storage 90 electric power generation from burning fossil fuels can be replaced by power generation from nuclear and renewables for poor nations heating and home stoves that contribute much to regional air pollution can be replaced by a much cleaner fossil fuel like natural gas or ideally renewables motor vehicles driven by fossil fuels a key factor in urban air pollution can be replaced by electric vehicles though lithium supply and cost is a limitation there are alternatives herding more people into clean public transit such as electric trains can also help nevertheless even in emission-free electric vehicles rubber tires produce significant amounts of air pollution themselves ranking as 13th worst pollutant in los angeles 91 biodigesters can be utilized in poor nations where slash and burn is prevalent turning a useless commodity into a source of income the plants can be gathered and sold to a central authority that will break it down in a large modern biodigester producing much needed energy to use induced humidity and ventilation both can greatly dampen air pollution in enclosed spaces which was found to be relatively high inside subway lines due to braking and friction and relatively less ironically inside transit buses than lower sitting passenger automobiles or subways 92 reduction efforts edit there are various air pollution control technologies and strategies available to reduce air pollution 93 94 at its most basic level land-use planning is likely to involve zoning and transport infrastructure planning in most developed countries land-use planning is an important part of social policy ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and population as well as to protect the environment because a large share of air pollution is caused by combustion of fossil fuels such as coal and oil the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as wind power solar power hydro power which don t cause air pollution 95 efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation many developing countries have permissive regulations citation needed expanding regulation to new sources such as cruise and transport ships farm equipment and small gas-powered equipment such as string trimmers chainsaws and snowmobiles increased fuel efficiency such as through the use of hybrid vehicles conversion to cleaner fuels or conversion to electric vehicles titanium dioxide has been researched for its ability to reduce air pollution ultraviolet light will release free electrons from material thereby creating free radicals which break up vocs and nox gases one form is superhydrophilic 96 in 2014 prof tony ryan and prof simon armitage of university of sheffield prepared a 10 meter by 20 meter-sized poster coated with microscopic pollution-eating nanoparticles of titanium dioxide placed on a building this giant poster can absorb the toxic emission from around 20 cars each day 97 a very effective means to reduce air pollution is the transition to renewable energy according to a study published in energy and environmental science in 2015 the switch to 100 renewable energy in the united states would eliminate about 62,000 premature mortalities per year and about 42,000 in 2050 if no biomass were used this would save about 600 billion in health costs a year due to reduced air pollution in 2050 or about 3.6 of the 2014 u.s gross domestic product 95 control devices edit the following items are commonly used as pollution control devices in industry and transportation they can either destroy contaminants or remove them from an exhaust stream before it is emitted into the atmosphere particulate control mechanical collectors dust cyclones multicyclones electrostatic precipitators an electrostatic precipitator esp or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas such as air using the force of an induced electrostatic charge electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device and can easily remove fine particulates such as dust and smoke from the air stream baghouses designed to handle heavy dust loads a dust collector consists of a blower dust filter a filter-cleaning system and a dust receptacle or dust removal system distinguished from air cleaners which utilize disposable filters to remove the dust particulate scrubbers wet scrubber is a form of pollution control technology the term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams in a wet scrubber the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid by spraying it with the liquid by forcing it through a pool of liquid or by some other contact method so as to remove the pollutants scrubbers

quality standards and e.u air quality directive set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels the second class such as the north american air quality index take the form of a scale with various thresholds which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity the scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants canada edit in canada air pollution and associated health risks are measured with the air quality health index or aqhi it is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution the air quality health index or aqhi is a federal program jointly coordinated by health canada and environment canada however the aqhi program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces municipalities and ngos from air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work related to aqhi implementation the aqhi provides a number from 1 to 10 to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality occasionally when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high the number may exceed 10 the aqhi provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today tonight and tomorrow and provides associated health advice 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 risk low 1-3 moderate 4-6 high 7-10 very high above 10 as it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population the index has been developed as a continuum the higher the number the greater the health risk and need to take precautions the index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as low moderate high or very high and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure 98 health risk air quality health index health messages 99 at risk population general population low 1-3 enjoy your usual outdoor activities ideal air quality for outdoor activities moderate 4-6 consider reducing or rescheduling strenuous activities outdoors if you are experiencing symptoms no need to modify your usual outdoor activities unless you experience symptoms such as coughing and throat irritation high 7-10 reduce or reschedule strenuous activities outdoors children and the elderly should also take it easy consider reducing or rescheduling strenuous activities outdoors if you experience symptoms such as coughing and throat irritation very high above 10 avoid strenuous activities outdoors children and the elderly should also avoid outdoor physical exertion and should stay indoors reduce or reschedule strenuous activities outdoors especially if you experience symptoms such as coughing and throat irritation the measurement is based on the observed relationship of nitrogen dioxide no2 ground-level ozone o3 and particulates pm2.5 with mortality from an analysis of several canadian cities significantly all three of these pollutants can pose health risks even at low levels of exposure especially among those with pre-existing health problems when developing the aqhi health canada s original analysis of health effects included five major air pollutants particulates ozone and nitrogen dioxide no2 as well as sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon monoxide co the latter two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and were removed from the aqhi formulation the aqhi does not measure the effects of odour pollen dust heat or humidity germany edit ta luft is the german air quality regulation hotspots edit main article toxic hotspots air pollution hotspots are areas where air pollution emissions expose individuals to increased negative health effects 100 they are particularly common in highly populated urban areas where there may be a combination of stationary sources e.g industrial facilities and mobile sources e.g cars and trucks of pollution emissions from these sources can cause respiratory disease childhood asthma cancer and other health problems fine particulate matter such as diesel soot which contributes to more than 3.2 million premature deaths around the world each year is a significant problem it is very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas and one in six people in the u.s live near a diesel pollution hot spot 101 external video airvisual earth – realtime map of global wind and air pollution 102 while air pollution hotspots affect a variety of populations some groups are more likely to be located in hotspots previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and or income hazardous land uses toxic storage and disposal facilities manufacturing facilities major roadways tend to be located where property values and income levels are low low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of social vulnerability including race a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution these communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma 103 studies show that patterns in race and income disparities not only indicate a higher exposure to pollution but also higher risk of adverse health outcomes 104 communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and racial minorities can be more vulnerable to cumulative adverse health impacts resulting from elevated exposure to pollutants than more privileged communities 104 blacks and latinos generally face more pollution than whites and asians and low-income communities bear a higher burden of risk than affluent ones 103 racial discrepancies are particularly distinct in suburban areas of the us south and metropolitan areas of the us west 105 clarification needed residents in public housing who are generally low-income and cannot move to healthier neighborhoods are highly affected by nearby refineries and chemical plants 106 cities edit see also list of most polluted cities in the world by particulate matter

concentrated in densely populated metropolitan areas especially in developing countries where environmental regulations are relatively lax or nonexistent 107 however even populated areas in developed countries attain unhealthy levels of pollution with los angeles and rome being two examples 108 between 2002 and 2011 the incidence of lung cancer in beijing near doubled while smoking remains the leading cause of lung cancer in china the number of smokers is falling while lung cancer rates are rising 109 another project focusing on the effects on pollution in vegetation has been researched by the local university in sheffield uk national-scale air toxics assessments 1995–2005 edit the national-scale air toxics assessment nata is an evaluation of air toxics by the u.s epa the epa has furnished four assessments that characterize nationwide chronic cancer risk estimates and noncancer hazards from inhaling air toxics the lates was from 2005 and made publicly available in early 2011 epa developed the nata as a state-of-the-science screening tool for state local tribal agencies to prioritize pollutants emission sources and locations of interest for further study in order to gain a better understanding of the risks nata assessments do not incorporate refined information about emission sources but rather use general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts than underestimate them nata provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from breathing inhaling air toxics in order to inform both national and more localized efforts to identify and prioritize air toxics emission source types and locations which are of greatest potential concern in terms of contributing to population risk this in turn helps air pollution experts focus limited analytical resources on areas and or populations where the potential for health risks are highest assessments include estimates of cancer and non-cancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources including assessments of non-cancer health effects for diesel particulate matter assessments provide a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged 110 most polluted cities by pm 111 particulate matter μg m³ 2004 city 168 cairo egypt 150

council directive 96 62 ec on ambient air quality assessment and management provides a common strategy against which member states can set objectives for ambient air quality in order to avoid prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment and improve air quality where it is unsatisfactory 112 on 25 july 2008 in the case dieter janecek v freistaat bayern curia the european court of justice ruled that under this directive 112 citizens have the right to require national authorities to implement a short term action plan that aims to maintain or achieve compliance to air quality limit values 113 this important case law appears to confirm the role of the ec as centralised regulator to european nation-states as regards air pollution control it places a supranational legal obligation on the uk to protect its citizens from dangerous levels of air pollution furthermore superseding national interests with those of the citizen in 2010 the european commission ec threatened the uk with legal action against the successive breaching of pm10 limit values 114 the uk government has identified that if fines are imposed they could cost the nation upwards of £300 million per year 115 in march 2011 the greater london built-up area remains the only uk region in breach of the ec s limit values and has been given 3 months to implement an emergency action plan aimed at meeting the eu air quality directive 116 the city of london has dangerous levels of pm10 concentrations estimated to cause 3000 deaths per year within the city 117 as well as the threat of eu fines in 2010 it was threatened with legal action for scrapping the western congestion charge zone which is claimed to have led to an increase in air pollution levels 118 in response to these charges boris johnson mayor of london has criticised the current need for european cities to communicate with europe through their nation state s central government arguing that in future a great city like london should be permitted to bypass its government and deal directly with the european commission regarding its air quality action plan 116 this can be interpreted as recognition that cities can transcend the traditional national government organisational hierarchy and develop solutions to air pollution using global governance networks for example through transnational relations transnational relations include but are not exclusive to national governments and intergovernmental organisations 119 allowing sub-national actors including cities and regions to partake in air pollution control as independent actors particularly promising at present are global city partnerships 120 these can be built into networks for example the c40 cities climate leadership group of which london is a member the c40 is a public non-state network of the world s leading cities that aims to curb their greenhouse emissions 120 the c40 has been identified as governance from the middle and is an alternative to intergovernmental policy 121 it has the potential to improve urban air quality as participating cities exchange information learn from best practices and consequently mitigate carbon dioxide emissions independently from national government decisions 120 a criticism of the c40 network is that its exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors

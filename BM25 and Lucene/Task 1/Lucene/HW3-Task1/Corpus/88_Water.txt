vapor-saturated air play media video demonstrating states of water present in domestic life water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of earth s streams lakes and oceans and the fluids of most living organisms its chemical formula is h2o meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds strictly speaking water refers to the liquid state of a substance that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure but it often refers also to its solid state ice or its gaseous state steam or water vapor it also occurs in nature as snow glaciers ice packs and icebergs clouds fog dew aquifers and atmospheric humidity water covers 71 of the earth s surface 1 it is vital for all known forms of life on earth 96.5 of the planet s crust water is found in seas and oceans 1.7 in groundwater 1.7 in glaciers and the ice caps of antarctica and greenland a small fraction in other large water bodies 0.001 in the air as vapor clouds formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air and precipitation 2 3 only 2.5 of this water is freshwater and 98.8 of that water is in ice excepting ice in clouds and groundwater less than 0.3 of all freshwater is in rivers lakes and the atmosphere and an even smaller amount of the earth s freshwater 0.003 is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products 2 a greater quantity of water is found in the earth s interior 4 water on earth moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation and transpiration evapotranspiration condensation precipitation and runoff usually reaching the sea evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land large amounts of water are also chemically combined or adsorbed in hydrated minerals safe drinking water is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation 5 there is a clear correlation between access to safe water and gross domestic product per capita 6 however some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability 7 a report issued in november 2009 suggests that by 2030 in some developing regions of the world water demand will exceed supply by 50 8 water plays an important role in the world economy approximately 70 of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture 9 fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world much of long-distance trade of commodities such as oil and natural gas and manufactured products is transported by boats through seas rivers lakes and canals large quantities of water ice and steam are used for cooling and heating in industry and homes water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of chemical substances as such it is widely used in industrial processes and in cooking and washing water is also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment such as swimming pleasure boating boat racing surfing sport fishing and diving etymology the word water comes from old english wæter from proto-germanic watar source also of old saxon watar old frisian wetir dutch water old high german wazzar german wasser old norse vatn gothic wato water from pie wod-or suffixed form of root wed-.. water wet 10 chemical and physical properties main articles properties of water water data page and water model water h 2o is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid nearly colorless with a hint of blue this simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the universal solvent for its ability to dissolve many substances 11 12 this allows it to be the solvent of life 13 it is the only common substance to exist as a solid liquid and gas in normal terrestrial conditions 14 states snowflakes by wilson bentley 1902 liquid water showing droplets and air bubbles caused by the drops water is a liquid at the temperatures and pressures that are most adequate for life specifically at a standard pressure of 1 atm 1.01325 bar 101.325 kpa 14.69595 psi water is a liquid between the temperatures of 273.15 k 0 °c 32 °f and 373.15 k 100 °c 212 °f increasing the pressure slightly lowers the melting point which is about −5 °c at 600 atm −22 °c at 2100 atm this effect is relevant for example to ice skating to the buried lakes of antartica and to the movement of glaciers at pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures increasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the boiling point that is about 374 °c at 220 atm this effect is important in among other things deep-sea hydrothermal vents and geysers pressure cooking and steam engine design at the top of mount everest where the atmospheric pressure is about 0.34 atm water boils at 68 °c 154 °f at very low pressures below about 0.006 atm water cannot exist in the liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by sublimation—a phenomenon exploited in the freeze drying of food at very high pressures above 221 atm the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable a state called supercritical steam water also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less dense as it freezes the maximum density of water in its liquid form at 1atm is 1,000 kg m3 62.43 lb cu ft that occurs at 3.98 °c 39.16 °f 15 the density of ice is 917 kg m3 57.25 lb cu ft 16 17 thus water expands 9 in volume as it freezes which accounts for the fact that ice floats on liquid water the details of the exact chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood some theories suggest that water s unusual behaviour is as a result of it having 2 liquid states 15 18 19 20 taste and odor pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths 21 and frogs are known to be able to smell it 22 however water from ordinary sources including bottled mineral water usually has many dissolved substances that may give it varying tastes and odors humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid 23 color and appearance the apparent color of natural bodies of water and swimming pools is often determined more by dissolved and suspended solids or by reflection of the sky than by water itself light in the visible electromagnetic spectrum can traverse a couple meters of pure water or ice without significant absorption so that it looks transparent and colorless 24 thus aquatic plants algae and other photosynthetic organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep because sunlight can reach them water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas through a thickness of 10 meters or more however the intrinsic color of water or ice is visibly turquoise greenish blue as its absorption spectrum has a sharp minimum at the corresponding color of light 1 227 m−1 at 418 nm the color becomes increasingly stronger and darker with increasing thickness practically no sunlight reaches the parts of the oceans below 1000 meters of depth infrared and ultraviolet light on the other hand is strongly absorbed by water the refraction index of liquid water 1.333 at 20 °c is much higher than that of air 1.0 similar to those of alkanes and ethanol but lower than those of glycerol 1.473 benzene 1.501 carbon disulfide 1.627 and common types of glass 1.4 to 1.6 the refraction index of ice 1.31 is lower than that of liquid water polarity and hydrogen bonding see also chemical bonding of h2o model of hydrogen bonds 1 between molecules of water capillary action of water compared to mercury impact from a water drop causes an upward rebound jet surrounded by circular capillary waves since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen atoms it is a polar molecule with an electrical dipole moment the oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive water is a good polar solvent that dissolves many salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as ethanol most acids dissolve in water to yield the corresponding anions many substances in living organisms such as proteins dna and polysaccharides are dissolved in water water also dissolves many gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide—the latter giving the fizz of carbonated beverages sparkling wines and beers on the other hand many organic substances such as fats and oils and alkanes are hydrophobic that is insoluble in water many inorganic substances are insoluble too including most metal oxides sulfides and silicates because of its polarity a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules these bonds are the cause of water s high surface tension 25 and capillary forces the capillary action refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of gravity this property is relied upon by all vascular plants such as trees 26 the hydrogen bonds are also the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of other analogous compounds like hydrogen sulfide h 2s they also explain its exceptionally high specific heat capacity about 4.2 j g k heat of fusion about 333 j g heat of vaporization 2257 j g and thermal conductivity between 0.561 and 0.679 w m k these properties make water more effective at moderating earth s climate by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere electrical conductivity and electrolysis pure water has a low electrical conductivity which increases with the dissolution of a small amount of ionic material such as common salt liquid water can be split into the elements hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it—a process called electrolysis the decomposition requires more energy input than the heat released by the inverse process 285.8 kj mol or 15.9 mj kg 27 mechanical properties liquid water can be assumed to be incompressible for most purposes its compressibility ranges from 4.4 to 6990510000000000000♠5.1×10−10 pa−1 in ordinary conditions 28 even in oceans at 4 km depth where the pressure is 400 atm water suffers only a 1.8 decrease in volume 29 the viscosity of water is about 10−3 pa·s or 0.01 poise at 20 °c and the speed of sound in liquid water ranges between 1400 and 1540 m s depending on temperature sound travels long distances in water with little attenuation especially at low frequencies roughly 0.03 db km for 1 khz a property that is exploited by cetaceans and humans for communication and environment sensing sonar 30 reactivity elements which are more electropositive than hydrogen such as lithium sodium calcium potassium and caesium displace hydrogen from water forming hydroxides and releasing hydrogen on earth main articles hydrology and water distribution on earth water covers 71 of the earth s surface the oceans contain 96.5 of the earth s water the antarctic ice sheet which contains 61 of all fresh water on earth is visible at the bottom condensed atmospheric water can be seen as clouds contributing to the earth s albedo hydrology is the study of the movement distribution and quality of water throughout the earth the study of the distribution of water is hydrography the study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology of glaciers is glaciology of inland waters is limnology and distribution of oceans is oceanography ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of ecohydrology the collective mass of water found on under and over the surface of a planet is called the hydrosphere earth s approximate water volume the total water supply of the world is 1,338,000,000 km3 321,000,000 mi3 2 liquid water is found in bodies of water such as an ocean sea lake river stream canal pond or puddle the majority of water on earth is sea water water is also present in the atmosphere in solid liquid and vapor states it also exists as groundwater in aquifers water is important in many geological processes groundwater is present in most rocks and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of faulting water in the mantle is responsible for the melt that produces volcanoes at subduction zones on the surface of the earth water is important in both chemical and physical weathering processes water and to a lesser but still significant extent ice are also responsible for a large amount of sediment transport that occurs on the surface of the earth deposition of transported sediment forms many types of sedimentary rocks which make up the geologic record of earth history water cycle main article water cycle water cycle the water cycle known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle refers to the continuous exchange of water within the hydrosphere between the atmosphere soil water surface water groundwater and plants water moves perpetually through each of these regions in the water cycle consisting of following transfer processes evaporation from oceans and other water bodies into the air and transpiration from land plants and animals into air precipitation from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to earth or ocean runoff from the land usually reaching the sea most water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea about 47 tt per year over land evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72 tt per year precipitation at a rate of 119 tt per year over land has several forms most commonly rain snow and hail with some contribution from fog and dew 31 dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest just before sunrise and when the temperature of the earth s surface starts to increase 32 condensed water in the air may also refract sunlight to produce rainbows water runoff often collects over watersheds flowing into rivers a mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a hydrological transport model some water is diverted to irrigation for agriculture rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce through erosion runoff shapes the environment creating river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers a flood occurs when an area of land usually low-lying is covered with water it is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea a drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply this occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation fresh water storage the bay of fundy at high tide left and low tide right main article water resources some runoff water is trapped for periods of time for example in lakes at high altitude during winter and in the far north and south snow collects in ice caps snow pack and glaciers water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers this groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells this water storage is important since clean fresh water is essential to human and other land-based life in many parts of the world it is in short supply sea water and tides main articles seawater and tides sea water contains about 3.5 sodium chloride on average plus smaller amounts of other substances the physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects it freezes at a lower temperature about −1.9 °c and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing the salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7 in the baltic sea to 4.0 in the red sea the dead sea known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30–40 is really a salt lake tides are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the tidal forces of the moon and the sun acting on the oceans tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and estuarine water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams the changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the moon and sun relative to the earth coupled with the effects of earth rotation and the local bathymetry the strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide the intertidal zone is an important ecological product of ocean tides effects on life an oasis is an isolated water source with vegetation in a desert overview of photosynthesis and respiration water at right together with carbon dioxide co2 form oxygen and organic compounds at left which can be respired to water and co2 from a biological standpoint water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life it carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication all known forms of life depend on water water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body s solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism in anabolism water is removed from molecules through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions in order to grow larger molecules e.g starches triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information in catabolism water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules e.g glucose fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes without water these particular metabolic processes could not exist water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration photosynthetic cells use the sun s energy to split off water s hydrogen from oxygen hydrogen is combined with co2 absorbed from air or water to form glucose and release oxygen all living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun s energy and reform water and co2 in the process cellular respiration water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function an acid a hydrogen ion h that is a proton donor can be neutralized by a base a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion oh− to form water water is considered to be neutral with a ph the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration of 7 acids have ph values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7 aquatic life forms further information hydrobiology marine life and aquatic plant some of the biodiversity of a coral reef some marine diatoms – a key phytoplankton group earth surface waters are filled with life the earliest life forms appeared in water nearly all fish live exclusively in water and there are many types of marine mammals such as dolphins and whales some kinds of animals such as amphibians spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land plants such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems plankton is generally the foundation of the ocean food chain aquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive and they do so in various ways fish have gills instead of lungs although some species of fish such as the lungfish have both marine mammals such as dolphins whales otters and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes see insect and mollusc siphons and gills carcinus however as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialisation for respiration in water effects on human civilization water fountain civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways mesopotamia the so-called cradle of civilization was situated between the major rivers tigris and euphrates the ancient society of the egyptians depended entirely upon the nile rome was also founded on the banks of the italian river tiber large metropolises like rotterdam london montreal paris new york city buenos aires shanghai tokyo chicago and hong kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade islands with safe water ports like singapore have flourished for the same reason in places such as north africa and the middle east where water is more scarce access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development health and pollution an environmental science program – a student from iowa state university sampling water water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or potable water water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or distillation or by a range of other methods water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water and is sometimes called safe water or safe for bathing chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations typically 1 part per million ppm for drinking water and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as chlorine or ozone or by the use of ultraviolet light in the usa non-potable forms of wastewater generated by humans may be referred to as greywater which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again and blackwater which generally contains sewage and other forms of waste which require further treatment in order to be made reusable greywater composes 50–80 of residential wastewater generated by a household s sanitation equipment sinks showers and kitchen runoff but not toilets which generate blackwater these terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures this natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places and its availability is a major social and economic concern currently about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who do not have access to safe water and sanitation during the 2003 g8 evian summit 33 even if this difficult goal is met it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water and over a billion without access to adequate sanitation poor water quality and bad sanitation are deadly some five million deaths a year are caused by polluted drinking water the world health organization estimates that safe water could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from diarrhea each year 34 water however is not a finite resource meaning the availability of water is limited but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation 35 in quantities many orders of magnitude higher than human consumption therefore it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth about 1 of our drinking water supply citation needed which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years citation needed that is a non-renewable resource and it is rather the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce clarification needed rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water to leave enough for local human consumption further explanation needed since the manufacturing process clarification needed uses around 10 to 100 times products masses in water clarification needed in the developing world 90 of all wastewater still goes untreated into local rivers and streams 36 some 50 countries with roughly a third of the world s population also suffer from medium or high water stress and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles 37 the strain not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes but it also degrades groundwater resources human uses further information water supply agriculture play media water distribution in subsurface drip irrigation irrigation of field crops the most important use of water in agriculture is for irrigation which is a key component to produce enough food irrigation takes up to 90 of water withdrawn in some developing countries 38 and significant proportions in more economically developed countries in the united states 30 of freshwater usage is for irrigation 39 fifty years ago the common perception was that water was an infinite resource at the time there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet people were not as wealthy as today consumed fewer calories and ate less meat so less water was needed to produce their food they required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers today the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense giving rise to the concept of peak water 40 this is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising and there is increasing competition for water from industry urbanisation and biofuel crops in future even more water will be needed to produce food because the earth s population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050 41 an assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the international water management institute in sri lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population 42 it assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity it found that a fifth of the world s people more than 1.2 billion live in areas of physical water scarcity where there is not enough water to meet all demands a further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing economic water scarcity where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water the report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future but that continuation of today s food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world to avoid a global water crisis farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently 43 as a scientific standard on 7 april 1795 the gram was defined in france to be equal to the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a meter and at the temperature of melting ice 44 for practical purposes though a metallic reference standard was required one thousand times more massive the kilogram work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one liter of water in spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at 0 °c—a highly reproducible temperature—the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water density which was measured at the time as 4 °c 39 °f 45 the kelvin temperature scale of the si system is based on the triple point of water defined as exactly 273.16 k or 0.01 °c the scale is an absolute temperature scale with the same increment as the celsius temperature scale which was originally defined according to the boiling point set to 100 °c and melting point set to 0 °c of water natural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16 but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes such as hydrogen-2 deuterium the amount of deuterium oxides or heavy water is very small but it still affects the properties of water water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less deuterium than seawater therefore standard water is defined in the vienna standard mean ocean water specification for drinking main article drinking water a young girl drinking bottled water water availability fraction of population using improved water sources by country the human body contains from 55 to 78 water depending on body size 46 to function properly the body requires between one and seven liters of water per day to avoid dehydration the precise amount depends on the level of activity temperature humidity and other factors most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water it is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people though most specialists agree that approximately 2 liters 6 to 7 glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration 47 medical literature favors a lower consumption typically 1 liter of water for an average male excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather 48 for those who have healthy kidneys it is rather difficult to drink too much water but especially in warm humid weather and while exercising it is dangerous to drink too little people can drink far more water than necessary while exercising however putting them at risk of water intoxication hyperhydration which can be fatal 49 50 the popular claim that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day seems to have no real basis in science 51 studies have shown that extra water intake especially up to 500 ml at mealtime was conducive to weight loss 52 53 54 55 56 57 adequate fluid intake is helpful in preventing constipation 58 hazard symbol for non-potable water an original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the food and nutrition board of the united states national research council read an ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods 59 the latest dietary reference intake report by the united states national research council in general recommended based on the median total water intake from u.s survey data including food sources 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters of water total for women noting that water contained in food provided approximately 19 of total water intake in the survey 60 specifically pregnant and breastfeeding women need additional fluids to stay hydrated the institute of medicine u.s recommends that on average men consume 3.0 liters and women 2.2 liters pregnant women should increase intake to 2.4 liters 10 cups and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters 12 cups since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing 61 also noted is that normally about 20 of water intake comes from food while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages caffeinated included water is excreted from the body in multiple forms through urine and feces through sweating and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath with physical exertion and heat exposure water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well humans require water with few impurities common impurities include metal salts and oxides including copper iron calcium and lead 62 and or harmful bacteria such as vibrio some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for taste enhancement and to provide needed electrolytes 63 the single largest by volume freshwater resource suitable for drinking is lake baikal in siberia 64 washing the propensity of water to form solutions and emulsions is useful in various washing processes many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water suspension of solids in water slurries or using water to dissolve and extract substances washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal body hygiene transportation main article ship transport the use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy chemical uses water is widely used in chemical reactions as a solvent or reactant and less commonly as a solute or catalyst in inorganic reactions water is a common solvent dissolving many ionic compounds as well as other polar compounds such as ammonia and compounds closely related to water in organic reactions it is not usually used as a reaction solvent because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is amphoteric acidic and basic and nucleophilic nevertheless these properties are sometimes desirable also acceleration of diels-alder reactions by water has been observed supercritical water has recently been a topic of research oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently heat exchange water and steam are a common fluid used for heat exchange due to its availability and high heat capacity both for cooling and heating cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea it s especially effective to transport heat through vaporization and condensation of water because of its large latent heat of vaporization a disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are oxidized faster by untreated water and steam in almost all thermal power stations water is used as the working fluid used in a closed loop between boiler steam turbine and condenser and the coolant used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by evaporation in a cooling tower in the united states cooling power plants is the largest use of water 39 in the nuclear power industry water can also be used as a neutron moderator in most nuclear reactors water is both a coolant and a moderator this provides something of a passive safety measure as removing the water from the reactor also slows the nuclear reaction down however other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling fire extinction water is used for fighting wildfires water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert which makes it a good fire extinguishing fluid the evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire it is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid use of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a steam explosion which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces and of a hydrogen explosion when substances which react with water such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal charcoal or coke graphite decompose the water producing water gas the power of such explosions was seen in the chernobyl disaster although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor s own water cooling system a steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam a hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot zirconium recreation main article water sport recreation grand anse beach st george s grenada west indies humans use water for many recreational purposes as well as for exercising and for sports some of these include swimming waterskiing boating surfing and diving in addition some sports like ice hockey and ice skating are played on ice lakesides beaches and water parks are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming and fountains and other water features are popular decorations some keep fish and other life in aquariums or ponds for show fun and companionship humans also use water for snow sports i.e skiing sledding snowmobiling or snowboarding which require the water to be frozen water industry a water-carrier in india 1882 in many places where running water is not available water has to be transported by people a manual water pump in china water purification facility reverse osmosis ro desalination plant in barcelona spain the water industry provides drinking water and wastewater services including sewage treatment to households and industry water supply facilities include water wells cisterns for rainwater harvesting water supply networks and water purification facilities water tanks water towers water pipes including old aqueducts atmospheric water generators are in development drinking water is often collected at springs extracted from artificial borings wells in the ground or pumped from lakes and rivers building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow other water sources include rainwater collection water may require purification for human consumption this may involve removal of undissolved substances dissolved substances and harmful microbes popular methods are filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material while chlorination and boiling kill harmful microbes distillation does all three functions more advanced techniques exist such as reverse osmosis desalination of abundant seawater is a more expensive solution used in coastal arid climates the distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems tanker delivery or as bottled water governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge reducing usage by using drinking potable water only for human consumption is another option in some cities such as hong kong sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water it becomes a waste of the resource regardless of benefits to the polluter like other types of pollution this does not enter standard accounting of market costs being conceived as externalities for which the market cannot account thus other people pay the price of water pollution while the private firms profits are not redistributed to the local population victims of this pollution pharmaceuticals consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on aquatic life if they bioaccumulate and if they are not biodegradable municipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at wastewater treatment plants mitigation of polluted surface runoff is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques see surface runoff mitigation and treatment industrial applications water is used in power generation hydroelectricity is electricity obtained from hydropower hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator hydroelectricity is a low-cost non-polluting renewable energy source the energy is supplied by the motion of water typically a dam is constructed on a river creating an artificial lake behind it water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators three gorges dam is the largest hydro-electric power station pressurized water is used in water blasting and water jet cutters also very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting it works very well is relatively safe and is not harmful to the environment it is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating or prevent saw blades from overheating water is also used in many industrial processes and machines such as the steam turbine and heat exchanger in addition to its use as a chemical solvent discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution pollution includes discharged solutes chemical pollution and discharged coolant water thermal pollution industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge food processing water can be used to cook foods such as noodles boiling steaming and simmering are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state steam water is also used for dishwashing water also plays many critical roles within the field of food science it is important for a food scientist to understand the roles that water plays within food processing to ensure the success of their products citation needed solutes such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water the boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes as well as air pressure which is in turn is affected by altitude water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations one mole of sucrose sugar per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by 0.51 °c 0.918 °f and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by 1.02 °c 1.836 °f similarly increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water s freezing point 65 solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food 66 water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water 65 solutes in water lower water activity—this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity 66 not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food but also the preservation and shelf life of food water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system it can dramatically affect the quality of a product as well as playing a role in sanitation water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains water is classified as soft if it contains less than 100 mg l uk 67 or less than 60 mg l usa 68 according to a report published by the water footprint organization in 2010 a single kilogram of beef requires 15 thousand litres of water however the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production 69 medical use sterile water for injection water for injection is on the world health organization s list of essential medicines 70 distribution in nature in the universe band 5 alma receiver is an instrument specifically designed to detect water in the universe 71 much of the universe s water is produced as a byproduct of star formation the formation of stars is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust when this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas the water observed is quickly produced in this warm dense gas 72 on 22 july 2011 a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing 140 trillion times more water than all of earth s oceans combined around a quasar located 12 billion light years from earth according to the researchers the discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence 73 74 water has been detected in interstellar clouds within our galaxy the milky way 75 water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies too because its components hydrogen and oxygen are among the most abundant elements in the universe based on models of the formation and evolution of the solar system and that of other star systems most other planetary systems are likely to have similar ingredients water vapor water is present as vapor in atmosphere of the sun in detectable trace amounts 76 atmosphere of mercury 3.4 and large amounts of water in mercury s exosphere 77 atmosphere of venus 0.002 78 earth s atmosphere ≈0.40 over full atmosphere typically 1–4 at surface as well as that of the moon in trace amounts 79 atmosphere of mars 0.03 80 atmosphere of ceres 81 atmosphere of jupiter 0.0004 82 – in ices only and that of its moon europa 83 atmosphere of saturn – in ices only and that of its moons titan stratospheric enceladus 91 84 and dione exosphere atmosphere of uranus – in trace amounts below 50 bar atmosphere of neptune – found in the deeper layers 85 extrasolar planet atmospheres including those of hd 189733 b 86 and hd 209458 b 87 tau boötis b 88 hat-p-11b 89 90 xo-1b wasp-12b wasp-17b and wasp-19b 91 stellar atmospheres not limited to cooler stars and even detected in giant hot stars such as betelgeuse mu cephei antares and arcturus 90 92 circumstellar disks including those of more than half of t tauri stars such as aa tauri 90 as well as tw hydrae 93 94 irc 10216 95 and apm 08279 5255 73 74 vy canis majoris and s persei 92 liquid water liquid water is present on earth covering 71 of its surface liquid water is also occasionally present in small amounts on mars scientists believe liquid water is present in the saturnian moons of enceladus as a 10-kilometre thick ocean approximately 30–40 kilometres below enceladus south polar surface 96 97 and titan as a subsurface layer possibly mixed with ammonia 98 jupiter s moon europa has surface characteristics which suggest a subsurface liquid water ocean 99 liquid water may also exist on jupiter s moon ganymede as a layer sandwiched between high pressure ice and rock 100 water ice water is present as ice on south polar ice cap of mars during martian south summer 2000 mars under the regolith and at the poles earth-moon system mainly as ice sheets on earth and in lunar craters and volcanic rocks 101 nasa reported the detection of water molecules by nasa s moon mineralogy mapper aboard the indian space research organization s chandrayaan-1 spacecraft in september 2009 102 jupiter s moons europa s surface and also that of ganymede saturn in the planet s ring system 103 and on the surface and mantle of titan and enceladus pluto-charon system 103 comets and related kuiper belt and oort cloud objects and may also be present on mercury s poles 104 ceres tethys exotic forms water and other volatiles probably comprise much of the internal structures of uranus and neptune and the water in the deeper layers may be in the form of ionic water in which the molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions and deeper still as superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float about freely within the oxygen lattice 105 water and habitable zone further information water distribution on earth the existence of liquid water and to a lesser extent its gaseous and solid forms on earth are vital to the existence of life on earth as we know it the earth is located in the habitable zone of the solar system if it were slightly closer to or farther from the sun about 5 or about 8 million kilometers the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist 106 107 earth s gravity allows it to hold an atmosphere water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a temperature buffer greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature if earth were smaller a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes thus preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps as on mars the surface temperature of earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation insolation indicating that a dynamic process governs earth s temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo this proposal is known as the gaia hypothesis the state of water on a planet depends on ambient pressure which is determined by the planet s gravity if a planet is sufficiently massive the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures because of the high pressure caused by gravity as it was observed on exoplanets gliese 436 b 108 and gj 1214 b 109 law politics and crisis main articles water law water right and water crisis an estimate of the share of people in developing countries with access to potable water 1970–2000 water politics is politics affected by water and water resources for this reason water is a strategic resource in the globe and an important element in many political conflicts it causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity 1.6 billion people have gained access to a safe water source since 1990 110 the proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30 in 1970 111 to 71 in 1990 79 in 2000 and 84 in 2004 this trend is projected to continue 5 to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water is one of the millennium development goals this goal is projected to be reached a 2006 united nations report stated that there is enough water for everyone but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption 112 in addition global initiatives to improve the efficiency of aid delivery such as the paris declaration on aid effectiveness have not been taken up by water sector donors as effectively as they have in education and health potentially leaving multiple donors working on overlapping projects and recipient governments without empowerment to act 113 the authors of the 2007 comprehensive assessment of water management in agriculture cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply blueprints that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts the mekong river is one example a review by the international water management institute of policies in six countries that rely on the mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken they also discovered that cambodia s draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be 114 the un world water development report wwdr 2003 from the world water assessment program indicates that in the next 20 years the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30 40 of the world s inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene more than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from waterborne diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water or drought in 2004 the uk charity wateraid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases often this means lack of sewage disposal see toilet organizations concerned with water protection include the international water association iwa wateraid water 1st and the american water resources association the international water management institute undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty water related conventions are united nations convention to combat desertification unccd international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships united nations convention on the law of the sea and ramsar convention world day for water takes place on 22 march and world ocean day on 8 june in culture religion main article water and religion water is considered a purifier in most religions faiths that incorporate ritual washing ablution include christianity hinduism islam judaism the rastafari movement shinto taoism and wicca immersion or aspersion or affusion of a person in water is a central sacrament of christianity where it is called baptism it is also a part of the practice of other religions including islam ghusl judaism mikvah and sikhism amrit sanskar in addition a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including islam and judaism in islam the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water wudu unless water is unavailable see tayammum in shinto water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area e.g. in the ritual of misogi in christianity holy water is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of baptism the blessing of persons places and objects or as a means of repelling evil 115 116 philosophy the ancient greek philosopher empedocles held that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire earth and air and was regarded as the ylem or basic substance of the universe thales who was portrayed by aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer theorized that the earth which is denser than water emerged from the water thales a monist believed further that all things are made from water plato believed the shape of water is an icosahedron which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth 117 in the theory of the four bodily humors water was associated with phlegm as being cold and moist the classical element of water was also one of the five elements in traditional chinese philosophy along with earth fire wood and metal water is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular asian philosophy james legge s 1891 translation of the dao de jing states the highest excellence is like that of water the excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things and in its occupying without striving to the contrary the low place which all men dislike hence its way is near to that of the tao and there is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing so effectual for which it can be changed 118 guanzi in shui di 水地 chapter further elaborates on symbolism of water proclaiming that man is water and attributing natural qualities of the people of different chinese regions to the character of local water resources 119

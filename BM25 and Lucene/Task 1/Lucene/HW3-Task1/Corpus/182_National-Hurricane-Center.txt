center nhc is the division of the united states national weather service responsible for tracking and predicting weather systems within the tropics between the prime meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast pacific ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern atlantic ocean the agency which is co-located with the miami branch of the national weather service is situated on the campus of florida international university in university park florida 1 2 its tropical analysis and forecast branch tafb routinely issues marine forecasts in the form of graphics and high seas forecasts for this area year round with the ocean prediction center having backup responsibility for this unit the technology and science branch tsb provides technical support for the center which includes new infusions of technology from abroad the chief aerial reconnaissance coordination all hurricanes carcah unit tasks planes for research and operational purposes to tropical cyclones during the atlantic hurricane season and significant weather events including snow storms during winter and spring research to improve operational forecasts is done through the hurricane forecast improvement project hfip and joint hurricane test bed jht initiatives during the atlantic and northeast pacific hurricane seasons the hurricane specialists unit hsu issues routine tropical weather outlooks for the northeast pacific and northern atlantic oceans when tropical storm or hurricane conditions are expected within 48 hours the center issues watches and warnings via the news media and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa weather radio although the nhc is an agency of the united states the world meteorological organization has designated it as regional specialized meteorological center for the north atlantic and eastern pacific making it the clearinghouse for tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas if the center loses power or becomes incapacitated the central pacific hurricane center backs tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the northeast pacific ocean while the weather prediction center backs up tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the north atlantic ocean history edit early history edit location of miami hurricane warning office depicted by the arrow 1958–1964 see also history of atlantic hurricane warnings and tropical cyclone naming the first hurricane warning service was set up in the 1870s from cuba with the work of father benito viñes after his death hurricane warning services were assumed by the united states signal corps and united states weather bureau over the next decade first based in jamaica in 1898 and cuba in 1899 before shifting to washington d.c in 1902 3 4 the central office in washington which evolved into the national meteorological center and weather prediction center formally known as the hydrometeorological prediction center assumed hurricane warning advisory responsibility at that time this responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935 and the concept of the atlantic hurricane season was established to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time 5 the jacksonville hurricane warning office moved to miami florida in 1943 tropical cyclone naming began for atlantic tropical cyclones using the joint army navy phonetic alphabet by 1947 6 in 1950 the miami hurricane warning office began to prepare the annual hurricane season summary articles 7 in the 1953 atlantic season the united states weather bureau began naming storms which reach tropical storm intensity with human names 8 building which housed nhc from 1964–1978 at the university of miami ungar building the national hurricane research project begun in the 1950s used aircraft to study tropical cyclones and carry out experiments on mature hurricanes through its project stormfury 9 on july 1 1956 a national hurricane information center was established in miami florida which became a warehouse for all hurricane-related information from one united states weather bureau office 10 the miami hurricane warning office hwo moved from lindsey hopkins hotel to the aviation building 4 miles 6.4 km to the northwest on july 1 1958 11 forecasts within the hurricane advisories were issued one day into the future in 1954 before being extended to two days into the future in 1961 three days into the future in 1964 and five days into the future in 2001 12 the miami hwo moved to the campus of the university of miami in 1964 13 and was referred to as the nhc in 1965 14 the miami hwo tropical cyclone reports were done regularly and took on their modern format in 1964 15 as the national hurricane center edit national hurricane center directors director tenure ref gordan dunn

beginning in 1973 the national meteorological center duties renamed the hydrometeorological prediction center renamed for a second time in 2013 26 gained advisory responsibility for tracking and publicizing inland tropical depressions the world meteorological organization assumed control of the atlantic hurricane naming list in 1977 27 in 1978 the nhc s offices moved off the campus of the university of miami across u.s highway 1 to the ire financial building 28 male names were added into the hurricane list beginning in the 1979 season 29 the hurricane warning offices remained active past 1983 30 in 1984 the nhc was separated from the miami weather service forecast office which meant the meteorologist in charge at miami was no longer in a position above the hurricane center director 31 by 1988 the nhc gained responsibility for eastern pacific tropical cyclones as the former eastern pacific hurricane center in san francisco was decommissioned 32 in 1992 hurricane andrew blew the wsr-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of nhc s the miami state weather forecast offices 33 the radar was replaced with a wsr-88d nexrad system in april 1993 installed near metro zoo 34 near where hurricane andrew made landfall in 1995 the nhc moved into a new hurricane-resistant facility on the campus of florida international university capable of withstanding 130 mph 210 km h winds 35 its name was changed to the tropical prediction center in 1995 36 after the name change to tpc the hurricane specialists were grouped as a separate nhc unit under the tropical prediction center 36 separating themselves from the tropical analysis and forecast branch on october 1 2010 the tropical prediction center was renamed the nhc 37 and the group formerly known as the nhc became known as the hurricane specialists unit hsu 38 tropical cyclone forecasting is now done using statistical methods based on tropical cyclone climatology as well as methods of numerical weather prediction where computers use mathematical equations of motion to determine their movement 39 40 the world meteorological organization continues to create and maintain the annual hurricane naming lists naming lists use a six-year rotation with the deadliest or most notable storm names retired from the rotation 41 the current acting director of the national hurricane center is edward rappaport following the retirement of richard knabb on may 15 2017 a permanent replacement director has not been announced 25 organization edit for the fiscal year of 2008 the budget for the nhc was 6.8 million 40 a total of 66 people work for the nhc with 12 of the staff composing their management 38 the nhc has been one of the nine national centers which compose the national centers for environmental prediction ncep 42 hurricane specialists unit edit the hsu operations area comprises four desks pictured from which the tropics are monitored known as the nhc from 1995 through 2010 the hurricane specialists within the hurricane specialists unit hsu are the chief meteorologists that predict the actions of tropical storms the specialists work rotating eight-hour shifts from may through november monitoring weather patterns in the atlantic and eastern pacific oceans whenever a tropical or subtropical cyclone forms they issue advisories every six hours until the storm is over public advisories are issued more often when the storm expected to be of tropical storm or hurricane intensity threatens land 43 the specialists coordinate with officials in each country likely to be affected they forecast and recommend watches and warnings 44 during the hurricane season the hsu routinely issues their tropical weather outlook product which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones if systems occur outside the defined hurricane season the hsu issues special tropical weather outlooks 45 backup responsibility for their northeast pacific area resides at the central pacific hurricane center cphc 46 and vice versa if cphc were to have communication issues 47 north atlantic responsibilities are backed up by the weather prediction center wpc 40 routine coordination occurs at 1700 utc each day between the weather prediction center and national hurricane center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future 48 outside of the hurricane season the specialists concentrate on public education efforts 49

prior to being remodeled the national weather service areas of marine weather forecasting responsibility the tropical analysis and forecast branch tafb formerly the tropical satellite analysis and forecast unit and the tropical analysis center is a part of the national hurricane center and was created in 1967 50 the tafb is responsible for high seas analyses and forecasts for tropical portions of the atlantic and pacific between the prime meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast pacific ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern atlantic ocean 51 unlike the hurricane specialists unit hsu tafb is staffed full-time around the year other responsibilities of the tafb include satellite-derived tropical cyclone position and intensity estimates wsr-88d radar fixes for tropical cyclones tropical cyclone forecast support media support and general operational support 52 the ocean prediction center backs up tafb in the event of a communications outage and vice versa 53 technology and science branch edit the technology science branch tsb develops and transitions new tools and techniques into operations for tropical weather prediction in conjunction with other government and academic entities tsb created and continues development of the automated tropical cyclone forecasting atcf system used to incorporate various data and model outputs create and update hurdat and to generate tropical cyclone forecasts the tsb provides support for nhc computer and communications systems including its website tsb maintains a number of statistical and dynamical models used in predicting both tropical cyclone behavior and associated weather conditions the storm surge unit which develops and maintains software to forecast the storm surge of tropical cyclones is part of this branch 44 the techniques development and applications unit tdau is part of tsb 54 carcah edit the chief aerial reconnaissance coordination all hurricanes carcah is a subunit of the 53d weather reconnaissance squadron hurricane hunters carcah s mission is to provide a point-of-contact and to coordinate all tropical cyclone operational reconnaissance requirements at nhc and the central pacific hurricane center for the north atlantic caribbean gulf of mexico and the north pacific basin east of the international date line in accordance with the national hurricane operations plan nhop during the winter carcah coordinates the atlantic and pacific winter storm requirements in support of the national winter storms operations plan nwsop missions are flown in advance of the high-impact weather events forecast to affect the u.s. such as heavy snowfall 44 and at times when there is significant uncertainty within between numerical weather prediction output 55 hlt edit the hurricane liaison team hlt supports hurricane response through information exchange between the nhc the national weather service noaa nws and the emergency management community the hlt is composed of federal state and local emergency managers as well as nws meteorologists and hydrologists who maintain open lines of communication about the progress and threat level of the storm with appropriate federal state and local officials the team establishes and facilitates video and or teleconferences with the nhc fema and other federal agencies state emergency operations centers eocs weather prediction center hpc storm prediction center spc and river forecast centers rfcs 44 during significant landfalling hurricanes the president of the united states as well as affected city mayors and state governors join the daily briefing call which occurs at noon eastern daylight time 56 research edit as part of their annual tropical cyclone activity the agency issues a report on every tropical cyclone in the atlantic and eastern pacific ocean basins which are available since 1958 and 1988 respectively the report summarizes the synoptic history meteorological statistics casualties and damages and the post-analysis best track of a storm 57 the reports were formally known as preliminary reports up until 1999 58 the agency maintains archives and climatological statistics on atlantic and pacific hurricane history including annual reports on every tropical cyclone a complete set of tropical cyclone advisories digitized copies of related materials on older storms season summaries published as the monthly weather review and hurdat which is the official tropical cyclone database 59 programs are dedicated to improving the accuracy of tropical cyclone forecasts from the center the joint hurricane testbed jht is a joint operation between the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and united states weather research program to speed up the transfer of tropical cyclone-related research into forecast operations since 2001 with its annual budget of between 1.0 and 1.5 million the jht has funded 62 initiatives with most of them being implemented operationally the projects have had varied success ranging from minor to significant advances in the way the nhc operates 60 the hurricane forecast improvement program s hfip five-year goal is to lead to a 20 percent improvement within the numerical weather prediction models provided by the national centers for environmental prediction to nhc by 2015 and a 50 percent improvement within tropical cyclone track forecasting and intensity guidance by 2020 61

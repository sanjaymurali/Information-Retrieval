agents or sources who are considered to have become unreliable when spies are burned their connection to an espionage organization is terminated leaving them without access to cash or influence according to the narration during the opening credits the burned spy has no prior work history no money no support network – in essence no identity the television series uses second-person narrative and frequent voice-overs providing exposition from the viewpoint of covert-operations agent michael westen played by jeffrey donovan the voice-over commentary is in the form of tips for fledgling agents as if for a training or orientation film after being burnt in the middle of an operation in southern nigeria and being beaten and kidnapped to follow westen finds himself in his hometown 4 of miami florida he is tended to by his ex-girlfriend fiona glenanne but he has been abandoned by all his normal intelligence contacts and is under continuous surveillance with his personal assets frozen extraordinary efforts to reach his u.s government handler eventually yield only a grudging admission that someone powerful wants him on ice in miami if he leaves there he will be hunted down and taken into custody if he stays he can remain relatively free consumed by the desire to find out who burned him and why westen is reluctantly drawn into working as an unlicensed private investigator and problem solver for ordinary citizens to fund his personal investigation into his situation as a blacklisted agent westen invites his old friend sam axe to assist him while fiona invites herself to join them with the occasional assistance and sometimes hindrance of his mother madeline westen battles an array of criminals such as mobsters gang members con artists murderers rapists kidnappers foreign wet-work operatives drug traffickers sex traffickers arms traffickers and war criminals at the same time michael must follow the trail that leads him to the people responsible for his being burned and later finding out why the series juggles these two narratives the overall series dealing with why michael was burned and individual episodes focusing on the cases he works for clients cast

with his assets frozen he is forced to live off his wits and any small investigative jobs he can find while he searches for answers about who has burned him and why highly skilled and extremely clever he can think on his feet often improvising electronic devices and using ordinary items ranging from duct tape to cake frosting in highly unorthodox ways to complete a job he has two black belts or as he puts it in one episode thirty years of karate and is rated with anything that fires a bullet or holds an edge he has an uncanny ability to assume cover identities working in numerous regional dialects and international accents however he cannot speak spanish fluently he believes that his unhappy childhood largely at the hands of an abusive father has helped to make him into a natural covert operative while also making close relationships difficult for him he has a younger brother nate seth peterson who appeared in several episodes before being killed by a sniper in season 6 michael presents himself as a cynic hardened by experience but occasionally reveals a soft and sometimes vulnerable side his favorite food is yogurt which is featured or eaten by at least one of the characters in each episode he has a romantic relationship with fiona in the series finale he and fiona are living in ireland raising charlie nate s son as their own child gabrielle anwar as fiona glenanne a former ira operative and westen s ex-girlfriend fiona reenters michael s life when he is dumped in miami and she decides to stay quickly making herself valuable to him aside from serving as his firearms and explosives expert she provides support to him on his investigations and at times assists him in missions to find out who burned him in the pilot episode she speaks with an irish accent in the second episode she changes to an american accent along with a change in her style of dress in an effort to distance herself from her past and blend in showing her own ability to adapt she is both a complement to michael and his match in many ways both intellectually and tactically series creator matt nix has said about michael and fiona s relationship 5 the thing about the relationship with fiona is...they are two people who really don t have anybody else they can be with anybody else is going to be afraid of what michael does and it sort of turns her on and anybody else for michael is going to be uninteresting he is attracted to her but part of what we explore over the first season is they really are attracted with each other and yet there is a reason they broke up she is an incredibly chaotic person who just thrives on disorder.. violence is foreplay for her — matt nix where michael is concerned fiona is not entirely willing to let go of their past relationship which continues to simmer in the latter half of season 3 it is shown that the two of them are close to reigniting their relationship as season 5 starts the two move in together but tension in their romantic relationship remains however she is accused of the british consulate bombings as the antagonist anson fullerton tricks her into confessing to a crime she did not commit anson

presents himself as the guy who knows a guy and michael frequently relies on sam s seemingly inexhaustible list of contacts sam also uses the alias charles or chuck finley frequently during jobs it is revealed in the pilot that he is also an fbi informant reporting on westen under duress knowing this westen is able to pass false information to the fbi through sam who is glad to become his double agent at some point in the past sam foiled fiona s attempt to sell a large shipment of weapons to a libyan arms dealer costing her a good deal of money as a result fiona initially is very hostile towards him but the two eventually become very antagonistic friends sam will occasionally ask her for advice concerning his relationships with women and michael has said that the two of them make a good team sharon gless as madeline westen michael s mother maddie is a chain-smoking retiree although attempting to keep a sense of gravitas and self-importance she is family-oriented and fully supports both of her sons in times of need as well as helping michael with his clients in the mid-season finale of the third season she considers leaving miami but realizes her significance to his business until the events that start the series she had only infrequent communication with michael noting in the pilot that michael has missed his father s funeral by eight years during the first few seasons michael does not relish her company but he gradually grows to appreciate her strength and love despite this her appeals for help are michael s one great weakness and she has the ability to persuade him to do as she wishes coby bell as jesse porter season 4–7 a counterintelligence expert whom michael unwittingly burns when michael went looking for some classified files on a terrorist

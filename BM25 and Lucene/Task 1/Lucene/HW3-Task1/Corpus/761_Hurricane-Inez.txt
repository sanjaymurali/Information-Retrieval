caribbean bahamas florida and mexico in 1966 it was the first storm on record to affect all of those areas it originated from a tropical wave over africa and became a tropical depression by september 21 it moved slowly westward initially failing to intensify much it was upgraded to tropical storm inez on september 24 the storm strengthened into a hurricane and was quickly intensifying when it struck the french overseas region of guadeloupe on september 27 inez severely damaged the island s banana and sugar crops and thousands of homes were damaged leaving 10,000 people homeless damage on guadeloupe was estimated at 50 million nb 2 and there were 40 deaths after entering the caribbean inez briefly weakened before restrengthening attaining peak sustained winds of 150 mph 240 km h on september 28 that day a hurricane hunters flight reported a gust of 197 mph 317 km h which was the highest recorded at the time continuing westward inez made landfall as a small hurricane on the barahona peninsula of the dominican republic there the storm flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800 houses nationwide there were about 100 deaths and 12 million in damage after affecting

20.35 million in haiti prompting the united states government to send aid for the first time in nearly ten years due to previous mishandling of funds inez weakened quickly over hispaniola although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern cuba on september 30 in the country 125,000 people were forced to evacuate and there were three deaths and 20 million in damage the hurricane moved slowly over cuba for two days before emerging into the atlantic ocean near the bahamas it was expected to continue out to sea although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path in the bahamas heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding which killed five people and left 15.5 million in damage hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the florida keys where 160 homes and 190 trailers were damaged salt spray damaged crops in the region and there was 5 million in damage and four deaths in the straits of florida inez capsized a boat of cuban refugees killing 45 people in the northern gulf of mexico a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig killing 11 people the hurricane threatened the northern yucatán peninsula and although it remained offshore inez produced flooding and caused some power outages at its final landfall inez flooded portions of tamaulipas and cut off roads to tampico about 84,000 people were left homeless and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500 houses damage was estimated at 104 million and there were 74 deaths in mexico meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the origins of inez were from a tropical wave that formed over the sahara in central africa on september 15 from the monsoon it moved westward in the prevailing winds exiting the west coast of africa on september 18 the precursor to inez was a disturbance along the northern portion of the wave 2 which was considered a tropical depression by september 18 in the annual tropical cyclone summary tracked by satellites the system moved to the west-southwest 3 and was officially classified a tropical depression on september 21 about halfway between the lesser antilles and africa 4 the system remained weak as it turned toward the west-northwest a hurricane hunters flight indicated some intensification in the system prompting the national hurricane center nhc to initiate advisories on tropical storm inez located about 800 mi 1,300 km east of martinique 3 with warm water temperatures the storm developed a circular area of convection over its center 2 inez slowed while curving westward around a ridge to its north and quickly intensified 3 reaching hurricane status on september 26 4 on september 27 inez strengthened to reach winds of 120 mph 195 km h making it a category 3 hurricane on the saffir–simpson scale 4 later that day it moved directly over the island of guadeloupe at the time inez was a small cyclone with hurricane-force winds extending 50 mi 80 km from the center 3 meteorologists labeled it as a micro-hurricane.. because of its characteristic small tight cloud structure and strong maximum surface wind 2 its structure became disrupted by the island and the central pressure rose from 961 mbar 28.4 inhg to 970 mbar 29 inhg indicative of weakening however inez re-intensified after entering the eastern caribbean sea reaching a minimum pressure of 929 mbar 27.4 inhg south of puerto rico on september 28 the hurricane hunters reported sustained winds of 197 mph 317 km h at a height of 8,000 ft 2,400 m the strongest winds recorded for the storm the same flight estimated surface winds between 150 to 175 mph 241 to 282 km h near the center 3 the peak intensity listed in the atlantic hurricane database is 150 mph 240 km h making inez a strong category 4 hurricane 4 this weather radar image of hurricane inez was taken on september 29 1966 at 0127 utc while near peak intensity inez was located about 160 mi 260 km southwest of san juan puerto rico and the eye was tracked by radar from the island its increasing outflow caused tropical storm judith to the east over the central atlantic to dissipate on september 29 the small but powerful hurricane made landfall on the barahona peninsula and quickly weakened over land it briefly moved offshore and struck the southern peninsula of haiti near jacmel the eye emerged into the windward passage near léogâne although severely weakened the pressure rose to 987 mbar 29.1 inhg 3 and the winds decreased to 90 mph 150 km h over land however inez quickly re-intensified over water reaching winds of 115 mph 185 km h on september 30 before striking southeastern cuba near guantánamo bay 4 when inez was over cuba forecasters had difficulty in predicting the storm s future it was expected that the hurricane would move to the north off the east coast of the united states due to a weakness in the ridge to the north the hurricane drifted west-northwestward within light steering currents weakening over the high terrain but later moving offshore the southern coast of cuba while over water the eye reorganized and the cyclone maintained hurricane intensity inez eventually turned to a northward drift over central cuba and emerged into the atlantic ocean on october 2 3 hurricane inez near yucatán peninsula shortly after exiting cuba into the atlantic inez weakened into a tropical storm and was moving northeastward through the bahamas about 24 hours later than forecast 3 at the time the storm was expected to continue to the northeast around the bermuda high 2 with little outflow and a large diffuse circulation inez did not restrengthen much despite otherwise favorable conditions 3 potentially due to a nearby trough 2 the movement slowed and the 1966 hurricane summary remarked that inez probably became nearly stationary closer to the united states mainland than any other storm on october 3 inez turned to the west-southwest as another ridge strengthened over the western gulf of mexico over the subsequent few days the eye moved directly over the florida keys from key largo to key west and continued through the gulf of mexico while slowly intensifying on october 7 inez brushed the northern coast of the yucatán peninsula with hurricane-force winds by then the ridge had begun to weaken allowing the hurricane to turn more west-northwestward 3 on october 8 inez attained a secondary peak intensity of 140 mph 220 km h 4 with a pressure of 948 mbar 28.0 inhg briefly threatening the coastline of texas inez turned to the southwest after the ridge again strengthened on october 10 the hurricane made its final landfall near tampico tamaulipas in northeastern mexico it weakened rapidly over the region s high terrain dissipating on october 11 3 the unusual track of inez marked the first time on record that a tropical cyclone affected the lesser and greater antilles bahamas florida and mexico 3 the associated press described inez as the first to strike the yucatán peninsula in many years 5 it was also the first to move across the gulf of mexico without turning to the north so late in the season and the 65 advisories issued by the nhc was the highest number at the time the path taken by inez was compared to hurricane betsy in 1965 which also slowed and moved erratically due to a strong ridge 3 forecasters had difficulty with the hurricane because of its unusual path as well as the inability to fly the hurricane hunters into inez while it was over cuba 6 preparations edit in guadeloupe which was the first area the hurricane affected residents evacuated to schools set up as shelters pan american world airways canceled flights to the region 7 when inez was near peak intensity the nhc warned residents in southern haiti and the dominican republic of the danger posed by the hurricane the agency emphasized that the eye was visible on radar to calm tension of an unexpected change in track in general hurricane warnings were issued 24 hours in advance with the exception of southeastern florida due to the hurricane s slowing track 3 overall 250,000 people evacuated along the path of inez 8 at guantánamo bay officials ordered residents at the naval base to evacuate to storm shelters large ships at the port there were moved to jamaica before the storm struck 9 throughout eastern cuba premier fidel castro ordered about 125,000 people to evacuate in low-lying areas mostly in oriente province 10 united states air force tracking stations in the bahamas were secured or moved to safer locations residents in the florida keys boarded up windows and store fronts 11 and hundreds of people evacuated to a shelter in key west in southeastern florida government offices and schools closed 12 along the yucatán peninsula about 15,000 people were evacuated from the coastal city of progreso 5 in a region that seldom experiences hurricanes 13 in the northern gulf of mexico a helicopter crashed after evacuating workers from an oil platform about 65 mi 105 km south-southwest of morgan city louisiana in otherwise calm conditions 11 people died including the pilot 14 when inez was approaching its final landfall the united states weather bureau issued hurricane warnings from brownsville to port isabel texas with gale warnings northward to corpus christi at least 2,000 people evacuated from port isabel alone 15 and many shrimp boats were secured 16 in the tampico area where inez made its final landfall over 31,000 people evacuated to higher grounds 17 impact edit satellite image of inez near peak intensity in the caribbean overall hurricane inez killed about 1,000 people mostly on hispaniola and caused over 200 million in damage crop damage was less than other storms of similar magnitude due to inez s small size and its occurrence late in the season 3 caribbean and bahamas edit when inez struck guadeloupe a station on the island reported sustained winds of 80 mph 130 km h with gusts to

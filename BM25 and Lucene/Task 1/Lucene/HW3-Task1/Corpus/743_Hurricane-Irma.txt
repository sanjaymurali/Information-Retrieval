hurricane season hurricane irma was an extremely powerful and catastrophic cape verde-type hurricane the strongest observed in the atlantic since wilma in 2005 in terms of maximum sustained winds it was the first category 5 hurricane to strike the leeward islands on record followed by hurricane maria only two weeks later it was also the most intense atlantic hurricane to strike the united states since katrina in 2005 and the first major hurricane to make landfall in florida since wilma in 2005 the ninth named storm fourth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime particularly in parts of the northeastern caribbean and the florida keys irma developed on august 30 2017 near the cape verde islands from a tropical wave that had moved off the west african coast three days prior 1 2 3 under favorable conditions irma rapidly intensified shortly after formation becoming a category 2 hurricane on the saffir–simpson scale within a mere 24 hours it became a category 3 hurricane and therefore a major hurricane shortly afterward however the intensity fluctuated between categories 2 and 3 for the next several days due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles on september 4 irma resumed intensifying becoming a category 5 hurricane by early the next day on september 6 irma reached its peak intensity with 185 mph 295 km h winds and a minimum pressure of 914 hpa 27.0 inhg making it the second most intense tropical cyclone worldwide so far in 2017 behind only hurricane maria and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed another eyewall replacement cycle caused irma to weaken back to a category 4 hurricane but the storm attained category 5 status for a second time before making landfall in cuba after dropping to category 3 intensity due to land interaction the storm re-intensified to category 4 status as it crossed warm waters between cuba and florida before making landfall on cudjoe key with maximum sustained winds at 130 mph 215 km h irma dropped back to category 3 by the time it made a second florida landfall on marco island irma weakened to a category 2 hurricane later that day the first time it weakened below major hurricane status in over a week and eventually dissipated off the coast of new england on september 16 the storm caused catastrophic damage in barbuda saint barthélemy saint martin anguilla and the virgin islands as a category 5 hurricane 4 5 as of september 30 the hurricane has caused at least 132 deaths

in the contiguous united states four in the u.s virgin islands and two others in unknown locations in the caribbean meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the national hurricane center nhc began monitoring a tropical wave over western africa on august 26 6 this wave moved off the coast of the continent late on august 27 throughout the next two days showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low pressure area as the system passed just south of and then through the cape verde islands on august 29 7 with the nhc stating that any significant organization of the disturbance would result in the classification of a tropical depression 8 further organization over the next 24 hours or so led to classification of the disturbance as tropical storm irma at 15 00 utc on august 30 based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates 9 with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear strengthening was anticipated with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air a viirs satellite image of hurricane irma on september 3 the nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow as an anticyclone became established over the system with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images 10 early on august 31 shortly after the development of a central dense overcast cdo and an eye feature irma rapidly intensified beginning at 09 00 utc on august 31 with winds increasing from 70 mph 110 km h to 115 mph 185 km h in only 12 hours 11 on september 2 a ship passed 60 mi 90 km to the west of the center of irma recording maximum winds of 45 mph 70 km h which indicated that the eye of irma remained compact 12 13 a strengthening subtropical ridge over the central north atlantic pushed irma from a western to southwestern direction on september 2 and 3 14 15 16 17 the first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from barbados on the afternoon of september 3 discovering an eye 29 mi 47 km in diameter and surface winds of 115 mph 185 km h 16 18 infrared loop of hurricane irma approaching the northern leeward islands on september 5 around the time of its upgrade to a category 5 hurricane on september 4 after moving into more favorable conditions irma strengthened into a category 4 hurricane 19 as it continued approaching the leeward islands irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification becoming a category 5 hurricane by 11 45 utc on the following day with winds of 175 mph 280 km h 20 as it began to take on annular characteristics the extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify 21 with maximum sustained winds peaking at 185 mph 295 km h

day around 21 00 utc the storm s pressure bottomed out at 914 hpa 27.0 inhg – this was the lowest in the atlantic since dean in 2007 while maintaining its intensity irma made successive landfalls at approximately 12 00 utc on sint maarten and at 17 00 utc on ginger island and tortola in the british virgin islands sea surface temperatures in hurricane irma s path shortly before 06 00 utc on september 8 irma made landfall on the bahamian island little inagua 23 about three hours later an eyewall replacement cycle caused irma to weaken to a category 4 hurricane but the storm regained category 5 status 18 hours later before making landfall in cuba after weakening to a category 3 due to land interaction with cuba irma reintensified into a category 4 hurricane while crossing over the straits of florida at 13 10 utc on september 10 irma made landfall in cudjoe key florida with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph 215 km h and a central pressure of 929 hpa 27.4 inhg 24 later that day

degenerated into a post-tropical low about 24 hours later north of tupelo mississippi 26 irma s remnants continued moving towards the northwest over the next day before turning northward and then accelerating to the northeast on september 14 27 early on september 15 irma s remnants began moving off the new england coastline becoming increasingly disorganized while continuing to weaken later on the same day irma s remnants began interacting with a cold front stretching over newfoundland 28 on september 16 irma s remnant circulation collapsed and the majority of irma s remnant moisture was absorbed into hurricane jose later that day 29 data collected by nasa showed that ocean surface temperatures in the path of irma were above 30 °c 86 °f at the time more than enough to sustain a category 5 hurricane 30 additionally ocean surface temperatures in areas between cuba and south florida extended to 32 °c 90 °f 31 32 which could support a maximum potential intensity of 200 miles per hour 320 km h if ideal conditions had been met 33 preparations edit caribbean edit given that irma s forecast track was along much of the caribbean island chain hurricane warnings were issued for the

total of three storm-related deaths have been reported on the island 135 in addition to the catastrophic impact on barbuda s human residents concern turned to the storm s effects on the island s wildlife the island s only endemic bird the near-threatened barbuda warbler numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane 154 it is unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath 154 barbuda s codrington lagoon home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the caribbean with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs was also inundated by the storm surge 154

yucatán peninsula by early on the following day the storm became a major hurricane after reaching category 3 intensity resuming its northwestward course carla continued intensification and on september 11 it was upgraded to a category 5 hurricane later that day carla weakened slightly but was still a large and intense hurricane when the storm made landfall near port o connor texas it weakened quickly inland and was reduced to a tropical storm on september 12 heading generally northward carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 13 while centered over southern oklahoma rapidly moving northeastward carla s remnants reached the labrador sea canada and dissipated on september 17, 1961 while crossing the yucatán channel the outer bands of carla brought gusty winds and severe local flooding in western cuba and the yucatán peninsula though no damage or fatalities were reported although initially considered a significant threat to florida the storm brought only light winds and small amounts of precipitation reaching no more than 3.15 in 80 mm in texas wind gusts as high as 170 mph 280 km h were observed in port lavaca additionally several tornadoes spawned in the state caused notable impacts with the most destructive twister an f4 near galveston texas resulting in 200 buildings severely damaged of which at least 60 were destroyed and 8 deaths and 55 injuries the aforementioned tornado remains the strongest hurricane-spawned tornado ever recorded with wind speeds in the tornado nearly 50 greater than carla s peak intensity throughout the state carla destroyed 1,915 homes 568 farm buildings and 415 other buildings additionally 50,723 homes 5,620 farm buildings and 10,487 other buildings suffered damage there were 34 fatalities and at

losses and 43 fatalities there were apparently 100 more undocumented deaths meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale as early as september 1 a tropical disturbance – an area of convective activity – was observed tracking westward across the caribbean sea within the intertropical convergence zone itcz around that time an anticyclone was situated over the western caribbean sea at the upper-tropospheric levels surface charts indicate that a low-level circulation was developing early on september 3 2 thus it is estimated that a tropical depression – a tropical cyclone with sustained winds with winds of less than 39 mph 63 km h – developed about 175 miles 282 km northwest of barranquilla colombia at 1200 utc 3 initially the center of circulation remained difficult to locate on surface charts due to lack of data at san andrés winds shifted west at about 12 mph 19 km h while barometric pressures dropped to 1,007 mbar 29.7 inhg the weather bureau office in miami florida issued its first bulletin at 1600 utc on september 4 while the depression was centered about 250 miles 400 km east-southeast of cabo gracias a dios nicaragua 2 it is estimated that sustained winds reached 45 mph 75 km h at 1200 utc on september 5 4 thus the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named carla while located just northeast of cabo gracias a dios 3 a reconnaissance aircraft flight reported that carla was continuing to intensify with surface winds of 50 mph 85 km h radars reported an unusually large tropical cyclone with convective bands extending about 520 miles 840 km outward from the center around 0000 utc on september 6 carla passed near swan island which reported a barometric pressure of about 995 mbar 29.4 inhg and wind gusts of 60 mph 95 km h from the southwest 4 based on observations obtained by a reconnaissance aircraft at 1100 utc on september 6 – namely a barometric pressure of 982 mbar 29.0 inhg – a bulletin issued by the weather bureau an hour later indicated that the storm had probably reached hurricane intensity 5 according to post-season analysis carla reached hurricane status at that time 3 radar image of carla from wsr-57 in galveston texas shortly after becoming a hurricane on september 6 carla curved northward in the northwestern caribbean sea at 1200 utc on september 7 the storm intensified into a category 2 hurricane while located east-northeast of cozumel quintana roo mexico actual use of the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale which was developed in 1971 was not in effect shortly thereafter carla crossed the yucatán channel and entered the gulf of mexico a strong high pressure area forced carla to resume its original northwesterly course early on september 8 the storm strengthened into a category 3 hurricane while located just north of the yucatán peninsula thus carla was the third major hurricane of the season carla was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane early on september 10 while approaching the gulf coast of the united states at 0000 utc on september 11 carla strengthened into a category 5 while located in the northwestern gulf of mexico six hours later the storm reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 175 mph 280 km h 3 although it weakened back to a category 4 hurricane late on september 11 carla reached its minimum

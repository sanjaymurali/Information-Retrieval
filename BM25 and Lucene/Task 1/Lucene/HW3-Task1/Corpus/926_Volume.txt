volume wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for other uses see volume disambiguation a measuring cup can be used to measure volumes of liquids this cup measures volume in units of cups fluid ounces and millilitres volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface for example the space that a substance solid liquid gas or plasma or shape occupies or contains 1 volume is often quantified numerically using the si derived unit the cubic metre the volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container i e. the amount of fluid gas or liquid that the container could hold rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes volumes of some simple shapes such as regular straight-edged and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas volumes of a complicated shape can be calculated by integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape s boundary where a variance in shape and volume occurs such as those that exist between different human beings these can be calculated using three-dimensional techniques such as the body volume index one-dimensional figures such as lines and two-dimensional shapes such as squares are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space the volume of a solid whether regularly or irregularly shaped can be determined by fluid displacement displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas the combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of one of the substances however sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and the combined volume is not additive 2 in differential geometry volume is expressed by means of the volume form and is an important global riemannian invariant in thermodynamics volume is a fundamental parameter and is a conjugate variable to pressure units edit volume measurements from the

corresponding unit of volume the volume of a cube whose sides have the given length for example a cubic centimetre cm3 is the volume of a cube whose sides are one centimetre 1 cm in length in the international system of units si the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre m3 the metric system also includes the litre l as a unit of volume where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube thus 1 litre 10 cm 3 1000 cubic centimetres 0.001 cubic metres so 1 cubic metre 1000 litres small amounts of liquid are often measured in millilitres where 1 millilitre 0.001 litres 1 cubic centimetre various other traditional units of volume are also in use including the cubic inch the cubic foot the cubic mile the teaspoon the tablespoon the fluid ounce the fluid dram the gill the pint the quart the gallon the minim the barrel the cord the peck the bushel and the hogshead related terms edit capacity is defined by the oxford english dictionary as the measure applied to the content of a vessel and to liquids grain or the like which take the shape of that which holds them 4 the word capacity has other unrelated meanings as in e.g capacity management capacity is not identical in meaning to volume though closely related the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior units of capacity are the si litre and its derived units and imperial units such as gill pint gallon and others units of volume are the cubes of units of length in si the units of volume and capacity are closely related one litre is exactly 1 cubic decimetre the capacity of a cube with a 10 cm side in other systems the conversion is not trivial the capacity of a vehicle s fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet for example but in gallons a gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft the density of an object is defined as the ratio of the mass to the volume 5 the inverse of density is specific volume which is defined as volume divided by mass specific volume is a concept important in thermodynamics where the volume of a working fluid is often an important parameter of a system being studied the volumetric flow rate in fluid dynamics is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per

differential geometry a branch of mathematics a volume form on a differentiable manifold is a differential form of top degree i.e. whose degree is equal to the dimension of the manifold that is nowhere equal to zero a manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable an orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms since multiplying a volume form by a non-vanishing function yields another volume form on non-orientable manifolds one may instead define the weaker notion of a density integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that form an

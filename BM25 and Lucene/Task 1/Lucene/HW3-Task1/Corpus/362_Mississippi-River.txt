system on the north american continent second only to the hudson bay drainage system 10 11 flowing entirely in the united states although its drainage basin reaches into canada it rises in northern minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for 2,320 miles 3,730 km 11 to the mississippi river delta at the gulf of mexico with its many tributaries the mississippi s watershed drains all or parts of 31 u.s states and 2 canadian provinces between the rocky and appalachian mountains the mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest and fifteenth-largest river in the world by discharge the river either borders or passes through the states of minnesota wisconsin iowa illinois missouri kentucky tennessee arkansas mississippi and louisiana 12 13 native americans long lived along the mississippi river and its tributaries most were hunter-gatherers but some such as the mound builders formed prolific agricultural societies the arrival of europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers then settlers ventured into the basin in increasing numbers 14 the river served first as a barrier forming borders for new spain new france and the early united states and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link in the 19th century during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny the mississippi and several western tributaries most notably the missouri formed pathways for the western expansion of the united states formed from thick layers of the river s silt deposits the mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile agricultural regions of the country which resulted in the river s storied steamboat era during the american civil war the mississippi s capture by union forces marked a turning point towards victory due to the river s importance as a route of trade and travel not least to the confederacy because of substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that supplanted riverboats the first decades of the 20th century saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees locks and dams often built in combination since modern development of the basin began the mississippi has also seen its share of pollution and environmental problems – most notably large volumes of agricultural runoff which has led to the gulf of mexico dead zone off the delta in recent years the river has shown a steady shift towards the atchafalaya river channel in the delta a course change would be an economic disaster for the port city of new orleans name and significance edit the word itself comes from messipi the french rendering of the anishinaabe ojibwe or algonquin name for the river misi-ziibi great river in the 18th century the river was the primary western boundary of the young united states and since the country s expansion westward the mississippi river has been widely considered a convenient if approximate dividing line between the eastern southern and midwestern united states and the western united states this is exemplified by the gateway arch in st louis and the phrase trans-mississippi as used in the name of the trans-mississippi exposition it is common to qualify a regionally superlative landmark in relation to it such as the highest peak east of the mississippi 15 or the oldest city west of the mississippi 16 the fcc also uses it as the dividing line for broadcast callsigns which begin with w to the east and k to the west mixing together in media markets along the river physical geography edit the geographical setting of the mississippi river includes considerations of the course of the river itself its watershed its outflow its prehistoric and historic course changes and possibilities of future course changes the new madrid seismic zone along the river is also noteworthy these various basic geographical aspects of the river in turn underlie its human history and present uses of the waterway and its adjacent lands divisions edit the mississippi river can be divided into three sections the upper mississippi the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the missouri river the middle mississippi which is downriver from the missouri to the ohio river and the lower mississippi which flows from the ohio to the gulf of mexico upper mississippi edit the beginning of the mississippi river at lake itasca 2004 mississippi head of navigation st anthony falls confluence of the wisconsin and mississippi rivers viewed from wyalusing state park in wisconsin the upper mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the missouri river at st louis missouri it is divided into two sections the headwaters 493 miles 793 km from the source to saint anthony falls in minneapolis minnesota and a navigable channel formed by a series of man-made lakes between minneapolis and st louis missouri some 664 miles 1,069 km the source of the upper mississippi branch is traditionally accepted as lake itasca 1,475 feet 450 m above sea level in itasca state park in clearwater county minnesota the name itasca was chosen to designate the true head of the mississippi river as a combination of the last four letters of the latin word for truth veritas and the first two letters of the latin word for head caput 17 however the lake is in turn fed by a number of smaller streams from its origin at lake itasca to st louis missouri the waterway s flow is moderated by 43 dams fourteen of these dams are located above minneapolis in the headwaters region and serve multiple purposes including power generation and recreation the remaining 29 dams beginning in downtown minneapolis all contain locks and were constructed to improve commercial navigation of the upper river taken as a whole these 43 dams significantly shape the geography and influence the ecology of the upper river beginning just below saint paul minnesota and continuing throughout the upper and lower river the mississippi is further controlled by thousands of wing dikes that moderate the river s flow in order to maintain an open navigation channel and prevent the river from eroding its banks the head of navigation on the mississippi is the coon rapids dam in coon rapids minnesota before it was built in 1913 steamboats could occasionally go upstream as far as saint cloud minnesota depending on river conditions the uppermost lock and dam on the upper mississippi river is the upper st anthony falls lock and dam in minneapolis above the dam the river s elevation is 799 feet 244 m below the dam the river s elevation is 750 feet 230 m this 49-foot 15 m drop is the largest of all the mississippi river locks and dams the origin of the dramatic drop is a waterfall preserved adjacent to the lock under an apron of concrete saint anthony falls is the only true waterfall on the entire mississippi river the water elevation continues to drop steeply as it passes through the gorge carved by the waterfall after the completion of the st anthony falls lock and dam in 1963 the river s head of navigation moved upstream to the coon rapids dam however the locks were closed in 2015 to control the spread of invasive asian carp making minneapolis once again the site of the head of navigation of the river 18 the upper mississippi has a number of natural and artificial lakes with its widest point being lake winnibigoshish near grand rapids minnesota over 11 miles 18 km across lake onalaska created by lock and dam no 7 near la crosse wisconsin is more than 4 miles 6.4 km wide lake pepin a natural lake formed behind the delta of the chippewa river of wisconsin as it enters the upper mississippi is more than 2 miles 3.2 km wide 19 by the time the upper mississippi reaches saint paul minnesota below lock and dam no 1 it has dropped more than half its original elevation and is 687 feet 209 m above sea level from st paul to st louis missouri the river elevation falls much more slowly and is controlled and managed as a series of pools created by 26 locks and dams 20 the upper mississippi river is joined by the minnesota river at fort snelling in the twin cities the st croix river near prescott wisconsin the cannon river near red wing minnesota the zumbro river at wabasha minnesota the black la crosse and root rivers in la crosse wisconsin the wisconsin river at prairie du chien wisconsin the rock river at the quad cities the iowa river near wapello iowa the skunk river south of burlington iowa and the des moines river at keokuk iowa other major tributaries of the upper mississippi include the crow river in minnesota the chippewa river in wisconsin the maquoketa river and the wapsipinicon river in iowa and the illinois river in illinois the upper mississippi is largely a multi-thread stream with many bars and islands from its confluence with the st croix river downstream to dubuque iowa the river is entrenched with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side the height of these bluffs decreases to the south of dubuque though they are still significant through savanna illinois this topography contrasts strongly with the lower mississippi which is a meandering river in a broad flat area only rarely flowing alongside a bluff as at vicksburg mississippi the confluence of the mississippi left and ohio right rivers at cairo illinois the demarcation between the middle and the lower mississippi river middle mississippi edit the mississippi river is known as the middle mississippi from the upper mississippi river s confluence with the missouri river at st louis missouri for 190 miles 310 km to its confluence with the ohio river at cairo illinois 21 22 the middle mississippi is relatively free-flowing from st louis to the ohio river confluence the middle mississippi falls 220 feet 67 m over 180 miles 290 km for an average rate of 1.2 feet per mile 23 cm km at its confluence with the ohio river the middle mississippi is 315 feet 96 m above sea level apart from the missouri and meramec rivers of missouri and the kaskaskia river of illinois no major tributaries enter the middle mississippi river lower mississippi edit lower mississippi river near new orleans the mississippi river is called the lower mississippi river from its confluence with the ohio river to its mouth at the gulf of mexico a distance of about 1,000 miles 1,600 km at the confluence of the ohio and the middle mississippi the long-term mean discharge of the ohio at cairo illinois is 281,500 cubic feet per second 7,970 cubic metres per second 23 while the long-term mean discharge of the mississippi at thebes illinois just upriver from cairo is 208,200 cu ft s 5,900 m3 s 24 thus by volume the main branch of the mississippi river system at cairo can be considered to be the ohio river and the allegheny river further upstream rather than the middle mississippi in addition to the ohio river the major tributaries of the lower mississippi river are the white river flowing in at the white river national wildlife refuge in east central arkansas the arkansas river joining the mississippi at arkansas post the big black river in mississippi and the yazoo river meeting the mississippi at vicksburg mississippi the widest point of the mississippi river is in the lower mississippi portion where it exceeds 1 mile 1.6 km in width in several places deliberate water diversion at the old river control structure in louisiana allows the atchafalaya river in louisiana to be a major distributary of the mississippi river with 30 of the mississippi flowing to the gulf of mexico by this route rather than continuing down the mississippi s current channel past baton rouge and new orleans on a longer route to the gulf 25 26 27 although the red river is commonly thought to be a tributary it is actually not because its water flows separately into the gulf of mexico through the atchafalaya river watershed edit map of the mississippi river watershed play media an animation of the flows along the rivers of the mississippi watershed see also list of drainage basins by area the mississippi river has the world s fourth-largest drainage basin watershed or catchment the basin covers more than 1,245,000 square miles 3,220,000 km2 including all or parts of 31 28 u.s states and two canadian provinces the drainage basin empties into the gulf of mexico part of the atlantic ocean the total catchment of the mississippi river covers nearly 40 of the landmass of the continental united states the highest point within the watershed is also the highest point of the rocky mountains mount elbert at 14,440 feet 4,400 m 29 sequence of nasa modis images showing the outflow of fresh water from the mississippi arrows into the gulf of mexico 2004 in the united states the mississippi river drains the majority of the area between the crest of the rocky mountains and the crest of the appalachian mountains except for various regions drained to hudson bay by the red river of the north to the atlantic ocean by the great lakes and the saint lawrence river and to the gulf of mexico by the rio grande the alabama and tombigbee rivers the chattahoochee and appalachicola rivers and various smaller coastal waterways along the gulf the mississippi river empties into the gulf of mexico about 100 miles 160 km downstream from new orleans measurements of the length of the mississippi from lake itasca to the gulf of mexico vary somewhat but the united states geological survey s number is 2,320 miles 3,730 km the retention time from lake itasca to the gulf is typically about 90 days 30 outflow edit the mississippi river discharges at an annual average rate of between 200 and 700 thousand cubic feet per second 7,000–20,000 m3 s 31 although it is the fifth-largest river in the world by volume this flow is a small fraction of the output of the amazon which moves nearly 7 million cubic feet per second 200,000 m3 s during wet seasons on average the mississippi has only 8 the flow of the amazon river 32 fresh river water flowing from the mississippi into the gulf of mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately the images from nasa s modis to the right show a large plume of fresh water which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter-blue surrounding waters these images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately instead it stayed intact as it flowed through the gulf of mexico into the straits of florida and entered the gulf stream the mississippi river water rounded the tip of florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of georgia before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by modis before 1900 the mississippi river transported an estimated 400 million metric tons of sediment per year from the interior of the united states to coastal louisiana and the gulf of mexico during the last two decades this number was only 145 million metric tons per year the reduction in sediment transported down the mississippi river is the result of engineering modification of the mississippi missouri and ohio rivers and their tributaries by dams meander cutoffs river-training structures and bank revetments and soil erosion control programs in the areas drained by them 33 course changes edit over geologic time the mississippi river has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course as well as additions deletions and other changes among its numerous tributaries and the lower mississippi river has used different pathways as its main channel to the gulf of mexico across the delta region through a natural process known as avulsion or delta switching the lower mississippi river has shifted its final course to the mouth of the gulf of mexico every thousand years or so this occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment begin to clog its channel raising the river s level and causing it to eventually find a steeper more direct route to the gulf of mexico the abandoned distributaries diminish in volume and form what are known as bayous this process has over the past 5,000 years caused the coastline of south louisiana to advance toward the gulf from 15 to 50 miles 24 to 80 km the currently active delta lobe is called the birdfoot delta after its shape or the balize delta after la balize louisiana the first french settlement at the mouth of the mississippi prehistoric courses edit the current form of the mississippi river basin was largely shaped by the laurentide ice sheet of the most recent ice age the southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present-day united states and mississippi basin when the ice sheet began to recede hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited creating the flat and fertile landscape of the mississippi valley during the melt giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the mississippi watershed creating such features as the minnesota river james river and milk river valleys when the ice sheet completely retreated many of these temporary rivers found paths to hudson bay or the arctic ocean leaving the mississippi basin with many features oversized for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period ice sheets during the illinoian stage about 300,000 to 132,000 years before present blocked the mississippi near rock island illinois diverting it to its present channel farther to the west the current western border of illinois the hennepin canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the mississippi downstream from rock island to hennepin illinois south of hennepin to alton illinois the current illinois river follows the ancient channel used by the mississippi river before the illinoian stage 34 35 view along the former riverbed at the

before c.1400 ad the red river of the south flowed parallel to the lower mississippi to the sea 15th century turnbull s bend in the lower mississippi extended so far west that it captured the red river of the south the red river below the captured section became the atchafalaya river 1831 captain henry m shreve dug a new short course for the mississippi through the neck of turnbull s bend 1833 to november 1873 the great raft a huge logjam in the atchafalaya river was cleared the atchafalaya started to capture the mississippi and to become its new main lower course 1963 the old river control structure was completed controlling how much mississippi water entered the atchafalaya cahokia s rise and fall linked to river flooding article in popular archaeology periodical historic course changes edit in march 1876 the mississippi suddenly changed course near the settlement of reverie tennessee leaving a small part of tipton county tennessee attached to arkansas and separated from the rest of tennessee by the new river channel since this event was an avulsion rather than the effect of incremental erosion and deposition the state line still follows the old channel 37 the town of kaskaskia illinois once stood on a peninsula at the confluence of the mississippi and kaskaskia okaw rivers founded as a french colonial community it later became the capital of the illinois territory and was the first state capital of illinois until 1819 beginning in 1844 successive flooding caused the mississippi river to slowly encroach east a major flood in 1881 caused it to overtake the lower 10 miles of the kaskaskia river forming a new mississippi channel and cutting off the town from the rest of the state later flooding destroyed most of the remaining town including the original state house today the remaining 2,300 acre island and community of 14 residents is known as an enclave of illinois and is accessible only from the missouri side 38 new madrid seismic zone edit the new madrid seismic zone along the mississippi river near new madrid missouri between memphis and st louis is related to an aulacogen failed rift that formed at the same time as the gulf of mexico this area is still quite active seismically four great earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 estimated at approximately 8 on the richter magnitude scale had tremendous local effects in the then sparsely settled area and were felt in many other places in the midwestern and eastern u.s these earthquakes created reelfoot lake in tennessee from the altered landscape near the river cultural geography edit state boundaries edit the mississippi river runs through or along 10 states from minnesota to louisiana and was used to define portions of these states borders with wisconsin illinois kentucky tennessee and mississippi along the east side of the river and iowa missouri and arkansas along its west side substantial parts of both minnesota and louisiana are on either side of the river although the mississippi defines part of the boundary of each of these states in all of these cases the middle of the riverbed at the time the borders were established was used as the line to define the borders between adjacent states 39 40 in various areas the river has since shifted but the state borders have not changed still following the former bed of the mississippi river as of their establishment leaving several small isolated areas of one state across the new river channel contiguous with the adjacent state also due to a meander in the river a small part of western kentucky is contiguous with tennessee but isolated from the rest of its state lake pepin the widest naturally occurring part of the mississippi is part of the minnesota–wisconsin border the mississippi river in downtown baton

upper mississippi river towboat and barges at memphis tennessee ships on the lower part of the mississippi a clear channel is needed for the barges and other vessels that make the main stem mississippi one of the great commercial waterways of the world the task of maintaining a navigation channel is the responsibility of the united states army corps of engineers which was established in 1802 43 earlier projects began as early as 1829 to remove snags close off secondary channels and excavate rocks and sandbars steamboats entered trade in the 1820s so the period 1830–1850 became the golden age of steamboats as there were few roads or rails in the lands of the louisiana purchase river traffic was an ideal solution cotton timber and food came down the river as did appalachian coal the port of new orleans boomed as it was the trans-shipment point to deep sea ocean vessels as a result the image of the twin stacked wedding cake mississippi steamer entered into american mythology steamers worked the entire route from the trickles of montana to the ohio river down the missouri and tennessee to the main channel of the mississippi only with the arrival of the railroads in the 1880s did steamboat traffic diminish steamboats remained a feature until the 1920s most have been superseded by pusher tugs a few survive as icons—the delta queen and the river queen for instance oil tanker on the lower mississippi near the port of new orleans barge on the lower mississippi river a series of 29 locks and dams on the upper mississippi most of which were built in the 1930s is designed primarily to maintain a 9-foot-deep 2.7 m channel for commercial barge traffic 44 45 the lakes formed are also used for recreational boating and fishing the dams make the river deeper and wider but do not stop it no flood control is intended during periods of high flow the gates some of which are submersible are completely opened and the dams simply cease to function below st louis the mississippi is relatively free-flowing although it is constrained by numerous levees and directed by numerous wing dams on the lower mississippi from baton rouge to the mouth of the mississippi the navigation depth is 45 feet 14 m allowing container ships and cruise ships to dock at the port of new orleans and bulk cargo ships shorter than 150-foot 46 m air draft that fit under the huey p long bridge to traverse the mississippi to baton rouge 46 there is a feasibility study to dredge this portion of the river to 50 feet 15 m to allow new panamax ship depths 47 19th century edit lock and dam no 11 north of dubuque iowa 2007 in 1829 there were surveys of the two major obstacles on the upper mississippi the des moines rapids and the rock island rapids where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock the des moines rapids were about 11 miles 18 km long and just above the mouth of the des moines river at keokuk iowa the rock island rapids were between rock island and moline illinois both rapids were considered virtually impassable in 1848 the illinois and michigan canal was built to connect the mississippi river to lake michigan via the illinois river near peru illinois the canal allowed shipping between these important waterways in 1900 the canal was replaced by the chicago sanitary and ship canal the second canal in addition to shipping also allowed chicago to address specific health issues typhoid fever cholera and other waterborne diseases by sending its waste down the illinois and mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of lake michigan the corps of engineers recommended the excavation of a 5-foot-deep 1.5 m channel at the des moines rapids but work did not begin until after lieutenant robert e lee endorsed the project in 1837 the corps later also began excavating the rock island rapids by 1866 it had become evident that excavation was impractical and it was decided to build a canal around the des moines rapids the canal opened in 1877 but the rock island rapids remained an obstacle in 1878 congress authorized the corps to establish a 4.5-foot-deep 1.4 m channel to be obtained by building wing dams which direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel by closing secondary channels and by dredging the channel project was complete when the moline lock which bypassed the rock island rapids opened in 1907 to improve navigation between st paul minnesota and prairie du chien wisconsin the corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area including lake winnibigoshish and lake pokegama the dams which were built beginning in the 1880s stored spring run-off which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth lock and dam no 2 near hastings minnesota

mississippi which was not complete when it was abandoned in the late 1920s in favor of the 9-foot-deep 2.7 m channel project in 1913 construction was complete on lock and dam no 19 at keokuk iowa the first dam below st anthony falls built by a private power company union electric company of st louis to generate electricity originally for streetcars in st louis the keokuk dam was one of the largest hydro-electric plants in the world at the time the dam also eliminated the des moines rapids lock and dam no 1 was completed in minneapolis minnesota in 1917 lock and dam no 2 near hastings minnesota was completed in 1930 before the great mississippi flood of 1927 the corps s primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river it was thought that the river s velocity would scour off bottom sediments deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding the 1927 flood proved this to be so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to create their own levee breaks to relieve the force of the rising river the rivers and harbors act of 1930 authorized the 9-foot 2.7 m channel project which called for a navigation channel 9 feet 2.7 m feet deep and 400 feet 120 m wide to accommodate multiple-barge tows 48 49 this was achieved by a series of locks and dams and by dredging twenty-three new locks and dams were built on the upper mississippi in the 1930s in addition to the three already in existence formation of the atchafalaya river and construction of the old river control structure project design flood flow capacity for the mississippi river in thousands of cubic feet per second 50 until the 1950s there was no dam below lock and dam 26 at alton illinois chain of rocks lock lock and dam no 27 which consists of a low-water dam and an 8.4-mile-long 13.5 km canal was added in 1953 just below the confluence with the missouri river primarily to bypass a series of rock ledges at st louis it also serves to protect the st louis city water intakes during times of low water u.s government scientists determined in the 1950s that the mississippi river was starting to switch to the atchafalaya river channel because of its much steeper path to the gulf of mexico eventually the atchafalaya river would capture the mississippi river and become its main channel to the gulf of mexico leaving new orleans on a side channel as a result the u.s congress authorized a project called the old river control structure which has prevented the mississippi river from leaving its current channel that drains into the gulf via new orleans 51 because the large scale of high-energy water flow threatened to damage the structure an auxiliary flow control station was built adjacent to the standing control station this 300 million project was completed in 1986 by the corps of engineers beginning in the 1970s the corps applied hydrological transport models to analyze flood flow and water quality of the mississippi dam 26 at alton illinois which had structural problems was replaced by the mel price lock and dam in 1990 the original lock and dam 26 was demolished a low-water dam deepens the

now actively creates and maintains spillways and floodways to divert periodic water surges into backwater channels and lakes as well as route part of the mississippi s flow into the atchafalaya basin and from there to the gulf of mexico bypassing baton rouge and new orleans the main structures are the birds point-new madrid floodway in missouri the old river control structure and the morganza spillway in louisiana which direct excess water down the west and east sides respectively of the atchafalaya river and the bonnet carré spillway also in louisiana which directs floodwaters to lake pontchartrain see diagram some experts blame urban sprawl for increases in both the risk and frequency of flooding on the mississippi river 52 some of the pre-1927 strategy is still in use today with the corps actively cutting the necks of horseshoe bends allowing the water to move faster and reducing flood heights 53 history edit native americans edit main articles woodland period hopewell

indigenous squash dates to the 4th millennium bce the lifestyle gradually became more settled after around 1000 bce during what is now called the woodland period with increasing evidence of shelter construction pottery weaving and other practices a network of trade routes referred to as the hopewell interaction sphere was active along the waterways between about 200 and 500 ce spreading common cultural practices over the entire area between the gulf of mexico and the great lakes a period of more isolated communities followed and agriculture introduced from mesoamerica based on the three sisters maize beans and squash gradually came to dominate after around 800 ce there arose an advanced agricultural society today referred to as the mississippian culture with evidence of highly stratified complex chiefdoms and large population centers the most prominent of these now called cahokia was occupied between about 600 and 1400 ce 55 and at its peak numbered between 8,000 and 40,000

jolliet and jacques marquette began exploring the mississippi in the 17th century marquette traveled with a sioux indian who named it ne tongo big river in sioux language in 1673 marquette proposed calling it the river of the immaculate conception when louis jolliet explored the mississippi valley in the 17th century natives guided him to a quicker way to return to french canada via the illinois

territory into east and west florida article 8 of the treaty of paris 1783 states the navigation of the river mississippi from its source to the ocean shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of great britain and the citizens of the united states with this treaty which ended the american revolutionary war britain also ceded west florida back to spain to regain the bahamas which spain had occupied during the war in 1800 under duress from napoleon of france spain ceded an undefined portion of west florida to france when france then sold the louisiana territory to the u.s in 1803 a dispute arose again between spain and the u.s on which parts of west florida exactly had spain ceded to france which would in turn decide which parts of west florida were now u.s property versus spanish property these aspirations ended when spain was pressured into signing pinckney s treaty in 1795 france reacquired louisiana from spain in the secret treaty of san ildefonso in 1800 the united states then secured effective control of the river when it bought the louisiana territory from france in the louisiana purchase of 1803 the last serious european challenge to u.s control of the river came at the conclusion of war of 1812 when british forces mounted an attack on new orleans – the attack was repulsed by an american army under the command of general andrew jackson in the treaty of 1818 the u.s and great britain agreed to fix the border running from the lake of the woods to the rocky mountains along the 49th parallel north in effect the u.s ceded the northwestern extremity of the mississippi basin to the british in exchange for the southern portion of the red river basin so many settlers traveled westward through the mississippi river basin as well as settled in it that zadok cramer wrote a guide book called the navigator detailing the features and dangers and navigable waterways of the area it was so popular that he updated and expanded it through 12 editions over a period of 25 years shifting sand bars made early navigation difficult the colonization of the area was barely slowed by the three earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 estimated at approximately 8 on the richter magnitude scale that were centered near new madrid missouri steamboat era edit main article steamboats of the mississippi mark twain s book life on the mississippi covered the steamboat commerce which took place from 1830 to 1870 on the river before more modern ships replaced the steamer the book was published first in serial form in harper s weekly in seven parts in 1875 the full version including a passage from the then unfinished adventures of huckleberry finn and works from other authors was published by james r osgood company in 1885 the first steamboat to travel the full length of the lower mississippi from the ohio river to new orleans was the new orleans in december 1811 its maiden voyage occurred during the series of new madrid earthquakes in 1811–12 the upper mississippi was treacherous unpredictable and to make traveling worse the area was not properly mapped out or surveyed until the 1840s only two trips a year to the twin cities landings were made by steamboats which suggests it was not very profitable 72 steamboat transport remained a viable industry both in terms of passengers and freight until the end of the first decade of the 20th century among the several mississippi river system steamboat companies was the noted anchor line which from 1859 to 1898 operated a luxurious fleet of steamers between st louis and new orleans italian explorer giacomo beltrami wrote about his journey on the virginia which was the first steam boat to make it to fort st anthony in minnesota he referred to his voyage as a promenade that was once a journey on the mississippi the steamboat era changed the economic and political life of the mississippi as well as the nature of travel itself the mississippi was completely changed by the steamboat era as it transformed into a flourishing tourists trade 73 civil war edit battle of vicksburg ca. 1888 mississippi river from eunice arkansas a ghost town eunice was destroyed by gunboats during the civil war control of the river was a strategic objective of both sides in the american civil war in 1862 union forces coming down the river successfully cleared confederate defenses at island number 10 and memphis tennessee while naval forces coming upriver from the gulf of mexico captured new orleans louisiana the remaining major confederate stronghold was on the heights overlooking the river at vicksburg mississippi and the union s vicksburg campaign december 1862 to july 1863 and the fall of port hudson completed control of the lower mississippi river the union victory ending the siege of

mississippi and atchafalaya rivers to benefit the audubon society s upper mississippi river campaign 79 80 future edit geologists believe that the lower mississippi could take a new course to the gulf either of two new routes—through the atchafalaya basin or through lake pontchartrain—might become the mississippi s main channel if flood-control structures are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe flood 81 82 83 84 85 failure of the old river control structure the morganza spillway or nearby levees would likely re-route the main channel of the mississippi through louisiana s atchafalaya basin and down the atchafalaya river to reach the gulf of mexico south of morgan city in southern louisiana this route provides a more direct path to the gulf of mexico than the present mississippi river channel through baton rouge and new orleans 83 while the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction maintenance and operation of various levees spillways and other control structures by the u.s army corps of engineers the old river control structure complex view is to the east-southeast looking downriver on the mississippi with the three dams across channels of the atchafalaya river to the right of the mississippi concordia parish louisiana is in the foreground on the right and wilkinson county mississippi is in the background across the mississippi on the left the old river control structure between the present mississippi river channel and the atchafalaya basin sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30 of the mississippi s flow to the atchafalaya river there is a steep drop here away from the mississippi s main channel into the atchafalaya basin if this facility were to fail during a major flood there is a strong concern the water would scour and erode the river bottom enough to capture the mississippi s main channel the structure was nearly lost during the 1973 flood but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play in particular the corps of engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity these additional facilities give the corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973 which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods such as that of 2011 because the morganza spillway is slightly higher and well back from the river it is normally dry on both sides 86 even if it failed at the crest during a severe flood the flood waters would have to erode to normal water levels before the mississippi could permanently jump channel at this location citation needed during the 2011 floods the corps of engineers opened the morganza spillway to 1 4 of its capacity to allow 150,000 ft3 sec of water to flood the morganza and atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the gulf of mexico bypassing baton rouge and new orleans 87 in addition to reducing the mississippi river crest downstream this diversion reduced the chances of a channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system 88 some geologists have noted that the possibility for course change into the atchafalaya also exists in the area immediately north of the old river control structure army corps of engineers geologist fred smith once stated the mississippi wants to go west 1973 was a forty-year flood the big one lies out there somewhere—when the structures can t release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way that is when the river s going to jump its banks and try to break through 89 another possible course change for the mississippi river is a diversion into lake pontchartrain near new orleans this route is controlled by the bonnet carré spillway built to reduce flooding in new orleans this spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 4–6 meters 12 to 20 feet high are all that prevents the mississippi from taking a new shorter course through lake pontchartrain to the gulf of mexico 90 diversion of the mississippi s main channel through lake pontchartrain would have consequences similar to an atchafalaya diversion but to a lesser extent since the present river channel would remain in use past baton rouge and into the new orleans area recreation edit great river road in wisconsin near lake pepin 2005 the sport of water skiing was invented on the river in a wide region between

realizations found within the woods surrounding the mississippi river many of the works of mark twain deal with or take place near the mississippi river one of his first major works life on the mississippi is in part a history of the river in part a memoir of twain s experiences on the river and a collection of tales that either take place on or are associated with the river the river was noted for the number of bandits which called its islands and shores home including john murrell who was a well-known murderer horse stealer and slave re-trader his notoriety was such that author twain devoted an entire chapter to him in life on the mississippi and murrell was rumored to have an island headquarters on the river at island 37 twain s most famous work adventures of huckleberry finn is largely a journey down the river the novel works as an episodic meditation on american culture with the river having multiple different meanings including independence escape freedom and adventure herman melville s novel the confidence-man portrayed a canterbury tales-style group of steamboat passengers whose interlocking stories are told as they travel down the mississippi river the novel is written both as cultural satire and a metaphysical treatise like huckleberry finn it uses the mississippi river as a metaphor for the larger aspects of american and human identity that unify the otherwise disparate characters the river s fluidity is reflected by the often shifting personalities and identities of melville s confidence man much of edna ferber s 1926 novel show boat takes place

hunger pickett s charge and other works are examinations of american history but are unusual in their probing of the interaction of human beings with their physical and social environments his greatest achievement as a novelist earth abides takes somewhat the same perspective but in the context of a collapse of civilization in which everything formerly taken for granted about civilization and the situation of human beings in their environment can no longer be assumed this radically altered circumstance permits stewart to raise and examine issues rarely if ever tackled by other novelists east of giants is historical fiction man an autobiography is one of the very few works of speculative anthropology in which he attempts to deduce how key developments in prehistorical civilization must have unfolded and also offers a wealth of original and interesting insights into the character of early civilization good lives provides a series of biographical sketches with the

extraordinary departure in itself and again teases out the consequences for human beings of this large-scale environmental disruption other works such as names on the land and american ways of life offer other unique insights and perspectives not found anywhere else taken together this enlightening body of work provides a breadth and depth of perspective found elsewhere only in authors like toynbee the durants and carroll quigley but in a far more palatable and accessible form achievements of this stature should have earned stewart a lasting reputation as one of america s greatest

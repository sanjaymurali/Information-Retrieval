away from the us mainland then back toward the mainland creating a series of sheltered islands between the outer banks and the mainland for thousands of years these barrier islands have survived onslaughts of wind and sea long stretches of beach sand dunes marshes and maritime forests create a unique environment where wind and waves shape the topography a large area of the outer banks is part of a national park called the cape hatteras national seashore it is also the nearest landmass on the us mainland to bermuda which is about 563 nautical miles 648 mi 1,043 km to the east-southeast the treacherous waters off the coast of the outer banks is known as the graveyard of the atlantic over 600 ships wrecked here as victims of shallow shoals storms and war diamond shoals a bank of shifting sand ridges hidden beneath the turbulent sea off cape hatteras has never promised safe passage for ships in the past 400 years the graveyard has claimed many lives but island villagers saved many as early as the 1870s villagers served in the us life-saving service others staffed lighthouses built to guide mariners few ships wreck today but storms still uncover the ruins of the old wrecks that lie along the beaches of the outer banks cape hatteras national seashore protects parts of three barrier islands bodie island hatteras island and ocracoke island beach and sound access ramps campgrounds nature trails and lighthouses can be found and explored on all three islands 1 the community of buxton lies on the inland side of the cape itself at the widest part of hatteras island it is the largest community on the island and is home to the governmental offices and schools for the island geography edit cape hatteras is a bend in hatteras island one of the long thin barrier islands that make up the outer banks it is the site where the two great basins of the east coast meet 2 the cape s shoals are known as diamond shoals climate edit an aerial view of where hurricane isabel cut inlets into hatteras island cape hatteras has a humid subtropical climate köppen cfa with long hot summers and short cool winters most of the area falls into usda plant hardiness zone 9 3 cape hatteras is surrounded by water with pamlico sound to the west and the atlantic ocean to the east the proximity to water moderates conditions throughout the year producing cooler summers and warmer winters than inland areas of north carolina 4 the cape is the northern limit of tropical fauna 5 during the summer average daily highs are in the 85 °f 29 °c range and occasional intense but brief thundershowers occur as a result of its proximity to water temperatures above 90 °f 32 °c are rare with an average of only 2.3 days annually above 90 °f 32 °c 6 one to three years out of each decade will not see any 90 °f readings the coolest month january has a daily high of 52 °f 11.1 °c with lows normally well above freezing 32 f the average window for freezing temperatures is from december 12 to march 11 allowing a growing season of 275 days between which there is an average of 21 nights with lows at or below the freezing mark 6 extremes in temperature range from 6 °f −14 °c on january 21 1985 up to 97 °f 36 °c on june 27 1952 6 snowfall is observed only occasionally and usually very light 4 precipitation mostly in the form of rain is over 58 inches 1,500 mm per year making it the wettest coastal location in north carolina 4 precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year however april and may represent a slightly drier season while august to october are the wettest months 4 on average august is the wettest month owing to high frequencies of both summer thunderstorms and tropical systems hurricanes tropical storms and tropical depressions that affect the area mostly from august to early october citation needed due to its exposed position cape hatteras is virtually the highest-risk area for hurricanes and tropical storms along the entire u.s eastern seaboard cape hatteras can experience significant wind and or water damage from tropical systems moving usually northward or northeastward near or over north carolina s outer banks while other areas i.e wilmington nc or myrtle beach and charleston sc to the south and norfolk va and maryland s eastern shore to the north experience much less minimal or no damage the cape hatteras area is infamous for being frequently struck by hurricanes that move up the east coast of the united states the strike of hurricane isabel in 2003 was particularly devastating for the area isabel devastated the entire outer banks and also split hatteras island between the two small towns of frisco and hatteras nc 12 which provides a direct route from nags head to hatteras island was washed out when the hurricane created a new inlet students had to use a ferry to get to school the inlet was filled in with sand by the army corps of engineers which took nearly two months to complete the road electrical and water lines were quickly rebuilt when the inlet was filled citation needed climate data for cape hatteras billy mitchell airport 1981–2010 normals a extremes 1898–present b month jan feb mar apr may jun jul

which later became part of the durant motel and was upended by hurricane isabel in 2003 the name hatteras is the sixth oldest surviving english place-name in the u.s an inlet north of the cape was named hatrask in 1585 by sir richard grenville the admiral leading the roanoke colony expedition sent by sir walter raleigh it was later applied to the island and cape as well and modified to hatteras 9 hatteras is the name of the hatteras indians 10 because mariners utilize ocean currents to speed their journey many ships venture close to cape hatteras when traveling along the eastern seaboard risking the perils of sailing close to the shoals amid turbulent water and the frequent storms occurring in the area so many ships have been lost off cape hatteras that the area is known as the graveyard of the atlantic cape hatteras is also well known for surfing 11 12 the first lighthouse at the cape was built in 1803 it was replaced by the current cape hatteras lighthouse in 1870 which at 198.48 feet 60.50 m from the ground to the tip of its lightning rod is the tallest lighthouse in the united states and one of the tallest brick lighthouses in the world in 1999 as the receding shoreline had come dangerously close to cape hatteras lighthouse the 4830-ton lighthouse was lifted and moved inland a distance of 2,900 feet 880 m its distance from the seashore is now 1,500 feet 460 m about the same as when it was originally built the e.m clark shipwreck and remains empire gem shipwreck and remains and uss monitor are listed on the national register of historic places 13 14

the first tropical cyclone since hurricane cesar–douglas in 1996 to survive the crossover from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean forming late on november 20 in the southwestern caribbean sea otto was the fifteenth and final named storm seventh hurricane and fourth major hurricane of the 2016 atlantic hurricane season it quickly intensified into a strong tropical storm the next day and on november 23–24 rapidly strengthened into a category 3 major hurricane the first in the month of november since hurricane paloma in 2008 and the latest date an atlantic hurricane attained such intensity on record 1 otto made landfall in nicaragua at peak intensity on november 24 thus becoming the latest hurricane to make landfall in the atlantic basin since 1851 when records began 1 traveling along the nicaragua–costa rica border the system rapidly weakened to a tropical storm before emerging over the eastern pacific ocean becoming the final storm of the 2016 pacific hurricane season as well hostile environmental conditions inhibited reorganization and otto subsequently degenerated into an elongated trough on november 26 the hurricane s unusually southern formation in the caribbean sea led to impacts in countries rarely affected by tropical cyclones in particular panama and costa rica suffered extensive damage the storm claimed at least 23 lives 10 in costa rica 9 in panama and 4 in nicaragua otto also dropped torrential rainfall across the affected regions some areas received up towards a month s worth of rain in only a matter of a day which led to life-threatening flooding which in turn led to landslides after the storm had passed recovery efforts begun with the national mourning of the victims followed by clean-up efforts overall total economic losses from the hurricane exceeded us 190 million meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on november 12 the national hurricane center nhc first noted the potential for a low pressure area to develop in the southwestern caribbean sea assessing a low probability for tropical cyclone formation within five days 2 after a convectively coupled kelvin wave and several nearby tropical waves interacted with each other in the aforementioned area atmospheric pressure in that region began falling on november 14 3 resulting in a broad low pressure area forming north of colombia on november 15 1 the low moved slowly and erratically with a disorganized structure and light winds 4 disrupted by unfavorable upper-level conditions 5 on november 19 the convection increased and became better organized amid marginally favorable conditions 6 the hurricane hunters flew into the system on november 20 observing a well-defined circulation and the system became a tropical depression at 18 00 utc that day 1 a series of microwave satellite images depicting the inner structure of hurricane otto as it traversed central america note that despite crossing land its eye remained largely intact the nascent depression meandered over the southwestern caribbean sea its path to the north blocked by a ridge 7 thunderstorm activity continued to pulse over the center 8 and the inner core of convection became more organized the depression intensified into a tropical storm by 06 00 utc on november 21 receiving the name otto 1 the storm had well-established outflow to the northeast fueled by warm water temperatures of around 84 °f 29 °c 9 after the convection organized into a central dense overcast otto became a strong tropical storm with 70 mph 110 km h winds and maintained that intensity for about a day on november 23 the storm reached hurricane intensity and began a period of rapid intensification reaching category 2 intensity by 06 00 utc the following day with winds of 105 mph 165 km h 1 six hours later otto reached its peak intensity as a category 3 major hurricane with winds of 115 mph 185 km h becoming the latest major hurricane on record in the satellite era 1 10 at 17 30 utc otto made landfall over the indio maíz biological reserve in southeastern nicaragua roughly 12 miles 19 km northwest of the nicaragua–costa rica border at peak intensity this marked the southernmost landfall of a hurricane in central america since reliable records began eclipsing hurricane irene–olivia of 1971 by 30 to 35 miles 50 to 55 km 1 after landfall otto s structure remained well-organized as it moved roughly parallel to the costa rica-nicaraguan border although cloud tops warmed indicating diminishing convection 11 despite moving over land the hurricane s eye remained well-defined and intact as it traverse nicaragua and costa rica 1 otto was the first atlantic hurricane on record to have its eye cross over costa rica 10 and the first hurricane-force system to traverse the nation 1 around 03 30 utc on november 25 the eye of otto emerged over the eastern pacific near the gulf of papagayo completing a rare crossover from the atlantic to eastern pacific basin—the first such occurrence in which an atlantic tropical cyclone retained its name after a change in nhc naming policy in 2000 1 concurrently the system weakened to a tropical storm continuing to move westwards due to the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north otto steadily weakened as it moved away from central america unfavorable environmental conditions hastened the system s demise and otto weakened to a tropical depression on november 26 soon thereafter the system degraded into a trough roughly 490 mi 790 km south of salina cruz mexico the remnant system continued to produce scattered convection for a few more days before dissipating entirely 1 preparations impact and aftermath edit panama edit tropical storm otto intensifying to the north of panama on november 22 in bocas del toro preparations were made even though otto was not expected to directly make landfall in the region several patients were evacuated from hospitals 12 the nation was put on hurricane alert according to panamanian president juan carlos varela in a press conference varela stated that up to 600 relief units had

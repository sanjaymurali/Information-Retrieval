is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in which tropical cyclones form in the northeastern pacific ocean the season officially started on may 15 in the eastern pacific and on june 1 in the central pacific they will both end on november 30 1 these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin however the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year this was demonstrated when the first storm tropical storm adrian was named on may 10 and became the earliest-known tropical storm in the east pacific since the advent of satellite imagery thus far the season has seen near-normal activity in terms of ace and has been an average season in terms of named storms although it does stand in stark contrast to the extremely active seasons in 2014 2015 and 2016 beginning this year the national hurricane center has the option to issue advisories and thus allow watches and warnings to be issued on disturbances that are not yet tropical cyclones but have a high chance to become one and are expected to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to landmasses within 48 hours such systems are termed potential tropical cyclones advisories on these storms contain the same content including track forecasts and cyclone watches and warnings as advisories on active tropical cyclones 2 this was first demonstrated on august 29 with the designation of potential tropical cyclone fourteen-e—which later developed into tropical storm lidia—south-southeast of the baja california peninsula seasonal

accumulated cyclone energy ace for the 2017 pacific hurricane season as of 09 00 utc on september 23 is 96.4025 units 95.47 units from the east pacific and 0.9325 units from the central pacific nb 2 although the east pacific hurricane season does not officially begin until may 15 activity began several days prior with the formation of a tropical depression on may 9 this marked the earliest formation of a tropical cyclone in the basin surpassing 1990 s hurricane alma 7 it intensified into tropical storm adrian a few hours later marking the earliest formation of a named storm on record 8 near normal activity occurred in june with tropical storm calvin formed on june 11 and hurricane dora on june 25 9 the following month was well above average july featured the fifth-highest ace value on record and boosted the seasonal value to almost double that of the long-term average 10 this total was attributed to long lived hurricanes eugene fernanda hilary and irwin august saw less activity

days with the possibility of tropical cyclone development thereafter 11 a broad cyclonic circulation began to develop as expected late on may 7 12 gradually organizing into the season s first tropical depression by 21 00 utc on may 9 13 upon formation at which point it was located about 545 mi 875 km south-southeast of salina cruz mexico the depression became the earliest-forming east pacific tropical cyclone east of 140°w on record the previous record was held by 1990 s hurricane alma which formed on may 12 7 the depression intensified into tropical storm adrian six hours later the earliest-known formation of a named storm in eastern pacific proper since the advent of the satellite era 14 initially forecasts expected the small storm to intensify into a powerful hurricane shortly after reaching peak intensity early on may 10 an unexpected increase in mid-level wind shear caused adrian to quickly weaken back to a tropical depression by 03 00 utc on may 11 15 early on the next day adrian degenerated into a remnant low 16 tropical storm beatriz edit tropical storm  sshws   duration may 31 – june 2 peak intensity 45 mph 75 km h 1-min   1001 mbar  hpa a tropical wave emerged off the western coast of africa on may 18 and entered the east pacific about a week later where steady organization led to the formation of a tropical depression around 12 00 utc on may 31 embedded within southwesterly flow around a large upper-level trough across northern mexico the depression moved steadily northeast in a favorable environment and it intensified into tropical storm beatriz by 06 00 utc on june 1 after attaining peak winds of 45 mph 75 km h the system made landfall around 00 00 utc on june 2 about 25 miles 40 km west of puerto Ángel the mountainous terrain of mexico quickly disrupted beatriz and it ultimately dissipated twelve hours later 17 in the state of oaxaca flights out of bahías de huatulco international airport were cancelled and schools were closed until at least june 3 dozens of roads were rendered impassable due to mudslides and flooding numerous locales received over 4 in 102 mm of rain with a storm total of 19.07 in 484.4 mm in huatulco 17 numerous landslides caused significant disruption across the state especially by blocking federal highway 200 at many areas a landslide in san marcial ozolotepec killed two girls and buried several houses while another in san carlos yautepec killed a woman 18 as of june 4 a total of seven people have been killed—five in oaxaca and two in tehuantepec 19 less than two weeks after beatriz tropical storm

tropical storm  sshws   duration june 11 – june 13 peak intensity 45 mph 75 km h 1-min   1004 mbar  hpa in the second week of june the nhc forecast the development of a broad area of low pressure a few hundred miles south of mexico over the next several days 21 this prediction came to fruition on june 9 22 and the fledgling disturbance steadily organized into a tropical depression by 12 00 utc on june 11 while located about 150 mi 240 km south-southeast of salina cruz 23 it was slow to organize initially amid moderate easterly wind shear as it drifted northwestwards 24 by 18 00 utc on june 12 however the tropical depression intensified into tropical storm calvin 23 intensifying slightly to reach winds of 45 mph 75 km h 23 calvin made landfall halfway between salina cruz and puerto Ángel near paja blanca around 00 00 utc on june 13 25 just 12 hours later calvin dissipated into a remnant low 23 the remnants of the storm caused heavy rainfall and some flooding in the area 26 however no fatalities were reported 23 hurricane dora edit category 1 hurricane  sshws   duration june 25 – june 28 peak intensity 90 mph 150 km h 1-min   981 mbar  hpa on june 21 the nhc began monitoring a broad area of low pressure south of the gulf of tehuantepec for possible tropical cyclogenesis 27 the disturbance organized into a tropical depression by 03 00 utc on june 25 28 and became a tropical storm six hours later receiving the name dora 29 progressing in a west-northwesterly direction at a steady speed the storm began a 30-hour period of rapid intensification and became the first hurricane of the season at 09 00 utc on june 26 30 with impressive upper-level outflow and an eye apparent on satellite imagery 31 the storm attained peak winds of 90 mph 150 km h by late on june 26 32 dora maintained its intensity for a number of hours before beginning to rapidly weaken over cooler sea surface temperatures and in an environment of drier air 33 the storm later degenerated into a remnant low early on june 28 after all of the storm s deep convection had dissipated 34 the outer bands of dora brought heavy rains to guerrero resulting in flash floods that inundated 20 homes overall damage was minor however 35 hurricane eugene edit category 3 hurricane  sshws   duration july 7 – july 12 peak intensity 115 mph 185 km h 1-min   965 mbar  hpa hurricane eugene developed from

period starting at 21 00 utc on july 8 eugene intensified from a tropical storm with 70 mph 110 km h winds to a category 3 hurricane with 115 mph 185 km h winds making it the first major hurricane of the season 37 38 however by 12 hours later the entrainment of dry air caused eugene to weaken to a category 2 hurricane 39 and due to traveling over cooler waters eugene weakened to a tropical storm on the following day 40 as the coverage of deep convection steadily dwindled eugene fell to tropical depression intensity around 15 00 utc on july 12 and degenerated to a remnant low six hours later 41 42 dangerous rip currents combined with swells of 4 to 8 ft 1.2 to 2.4 m across southern california resulted in hundreds of rescues on july 10 alone lifeguards in huntington beach made 200 rescues

145 mph 230 km h 1-min   947 mbar  hpa late on july 10 the nhc began monitoring a broad area of low pressure several hundred miles southwest of manzanillo contrary to predictions of gradual development 44 the disturbance rapidly organized into a tropical depression by 03 00 utc on july 12 45 and further strengthened to become tropical storm fernanda around 15 00 utc that day 46 the nascent cyclone initially battled moderate northeasterly wind shear with its low-level circulation displaced to the northeastern edge of the deep convection 47 this period of unfavorable upper-level winds was short-lived and soon afterwards fernanda commenced a period of rapid intensification intensifying into a hurricane at 21 00 utc on july 13 48 a well-defined eye formed within a growing central dense overcast and fernanda further intensified into a major hurricane early on july 14 49 only six hours later the system was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane 50 at 10.9°n fernanda became the second strongest hurricane to occur at such a low latitude in the eastern pacific only behind 2015 s hurricane olaf 51 with expansive upper-level outflow and spiral bands a distinct eye and a symmetric central dense overcast fernanda attained peak winds of 145 mph 230 km h around 03 00 utc on july 15 52 a series of microwave passes around that time began to indicate the formation of a secondary eyewall that halted the cyclone s development as it tracked west-northwest to northwest 53 the eyewall replacement cycle concluded early on july 16 allowing fernanda to remain a powerful hurricane amid favorable environmental conditions 54 by late on july 18 however cooler ocean temperatures and a more stable environment prompted the storm s weakening trend 55 fernanda fell below hurricane intensity shortly before entering the central pacific as it succumbed to stronger southwesterly wind shear 56 and after failing to produce sustained deep convection degenerated to a remnant low about 500 miles 805 km east of hilo hawaii by 21 00 utc on july 22 57 tropical storm greg edit tropical storm  sshws   duration july 17 – july 26 peak intensity 60 mph 95 km h 1-min   1001 mbar  hpa on july 12 the nhc forecast the formation of a broad area of low pressure south of mexico over subsequent days 58 the disturbance formed two days later and slowly organized into a tropical depression by 15 00 utc on july 17 59 60 the cyclone battled strong west-northwesterly wind shear after formation intensifying into tropical storm greg by 09 00 utc on july 18 as deep convection burst near the center but remained steady state for several days thereafter despite continued predictions of intensification 61 62 ultimately given global models poor handling of the environment nhc lowered their intensity forecast for greg 63 the cyclone continued west for the remainder of its life and maintained a similar convective structure with intermittent bursts of deep convection near the center 64 approaching the central pacific greg s low-level circulation became increasingly difficult to locate as it moved into a cooler drier environment intertwined by increasing southerly wind shear and the system weakened to a tropical depression around 21 00 utc on july 25 65 it degenerated to a remnant low 24 hours later 66 tropical depression eight-e edit tropical depression  sshws   duration july 18 – july 20 peak intensity 35 mph 55 km h 1-min   1007 mbar  hpa a low-pressure trough began producing disorganized convection over the waters of the pacific ocean well to the south of baja california peninsula on july 14 67 despite only marginally conducive environmental conditions the disturbance began to show signs of organization two days later 68 and it attained tropical depression status by 15 00 utc on july 18 69 strong west-northwesterly wind shear confined the storm s intermittent bursts of convection well to the southwest of its low-level circulation and the depression consequently failed to produce winds above 35 mph 55 km h 70 the system s center later degenerated into a low-pressure trough within the intertropical convergence zone prompting the nhc to discontinue advisories at 21 00 utc on july 20 71 hurricane hilary edit category 2 hurricane  sshws   duration july 21 – july 31 peak intensity 105 mph 165 km h 1-min   972 mbar  hpa part of an exceptionally active july the nhc began highlighting the far eastern reaches of the pacific basin on july 19 for tropical development in later days 72 a large area of disturbed weather progressed westward across costa rica later that day 73 steadily organizing into a tropical depression by 15 00 utc on july 21 74 the cyclone failed to organize immediately after formation and its low-level center migrated to the southern extent of associated convection 75 by 03 00 utc on july 23 though better defined banding features and a more organized convective structure led the nhc to designate the system as tropical storm hilary 76 over the coming hours the cyclone s convective structure evolved into a small central dense overcast while hints of an eye became apparent 77 in accordance with satellite estimates hilary was upgraded to a hurricane at 09 00 utc on july 24 78 a moist environment and warm ocean waters propelled hilary to its peak as a category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph 165 km h 24 hours later at which time its core was most symmetric 79 after maintaining its intensity the hurricane began to weaken late on july 26 as northerly wind shear increased 80 it fell back to tropical storm intensity around 03 00 utc on july 27 and ultimately degenerated to a remnant low four days later 81 82 hurricane irwin edit category 1 hurricane  sshws   duration july 22 – august 1 peak intensity 90 mph 150 km h 1-min   980 mbar  hpa on july 16 the nhc highlighted the expected formation of an area of low pressure south of mexico later that week 83 a tropical wave began producing disorganized cloudiness three days later 72 and the broad system slowly organized into a tropical depression by 15 00 utc on july 22 84 its structure changed little after formation impinged by strong wind shear despite this satellite wind data indicated the cyclone intensified into tropical storm irwin by 09 00 utc on july 23 85 over the next 24 hours deep convection began to wrap around the center and a mid-level eye formed as environmental conditions improved 86 by 09 00 utc on july 25 irwin intensified into a hurricane 87 although coolest cloudtops were located in the western semicircle of the system a well-defined eye and convection in the eyewall propelled irwin to its peak with winds of 90 mph 150 km h late on july 25 88 almost immediately outflow from nearby hurricane hilary increased wind shear over the system and caused it to begin weakening 89 irwin rapidly fell to tropical storm strength around 15 00 utc on july 26 90 contrary to projections of continued weakening however the storm s cloud pattern maintained or even improved over subsequent days as it passed over marginal ocean temperatures 91 finally after losing its deep convection and being reduced to a swirl of low-level clouds irwin was declared a remnant low around 21 00 utc on august 1 92 tropical depression eleven-e edit tropical depression  sshws   duration august 4 – august 5 peak intensity 35 mph 55 km h 1-min   1004 mbar  hpa on july 28 the nhc advertised the likely development of an area of low pressure well south of mexico over subsequent days 93 an area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave materialized three days later but little change occurred thereafter 94 early on august 3 a surface circulation formed in association with concentrating convection 95 and this process led to the formation of a tropical depression by 15 00 utc the next day 96 the newly formed cyclone did not intensify after designation and its low and mid-level circulations separated by over 265 mi 425 km on august 5 97 falling short of the tropical cyclone criteria the short-lived depression was declared a remnant low at 21 00 utc that day 98 tropical storm jova edit tropical storm  sshws   duration august 12 – august 14 peak intensity 40 mph 65 km h 1-min   1003 mbar  hpa the nhc began monitoring a strong tropical wave over the eastern caribbean on august 3 99 the feature pushed westward developing into hurricane franklin before making landfall on the yucatán 100 and attaining its peak as a category 1 hurricane before making landfall near vega de alatorre veracruz on august 10 101 although its low-level circulation dissipated the nhc in days prior noted the potential for franklin s mid-level remnants to reform in the east pacific 102 the remnants of franklin induced a surface low off the coast of southwestern mexico on august 11 and steady organization led to the formation of tropical storm jova by 03 00 utc the next day 103 on a westward course jova was plagued by strong wind shear from an area of high pressure over northwestern mexico with a very disorganized appearance on satellite 104 after lacking sufficient organization to be declared a tropical cyclone the storm was declared a remnant low around 03 00 utc on august 14 105 hurricane kenneth edit category 4 hurricane  sshws   duration august 18 – august 23 peak intensity 130 mph 215 km h 1-min   952 mbar  hpa on august 12 the nhc noted the potential for an area of low pressure to form well south of baja california peninsula during the following days 106 a large area of disturbed weather developed two days later as predicted 107 however organization was slow to occur and a tropical depression only formed four days later around 15 00 utc on august 18 108 the newly formed cyclone embarked on a west to west-northwest course intensifying into tropical storm kenneth early on august 19 and further into a hurricane by 15 00 utc on august 20 109 despite forecasts of only slight additional intensification 110 kenneth rapidly intensified with the eye feature warming dramatically and the surrounding cloud tops cooling the cyclone attained major hurricane strength around 03 00 utc on august 21 111 and six hours later reached its peak as a category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 130 mph 215 km h 112 progressively cooler sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear caused kenneth to steadily weaken following the intensification trend with its inner core eroding and low-level circulation becoming displaced 113 by 21 00 utc on august 22 the storm weakened below hurricane strength 114 the following day at 21 00 utc kenneth was declared post-tropical tropical storm lidia edit tropical storm  sshws   duration august 31 –

about 180 mi 290 km south-southeast of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula favorable conditions allowed lidia to intensify and by 21 00 utc on august 31 the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 987 mbar 29.1 inhg around 12 00 utc on the following day lidia made landfall near puerto chale baja california sur at the same intensity the cyclone weakened significantly while traversing the mountainous terrain of the baja california peninsula and by early on september 2 deep convection was mainly limited to a few strong clusters near the center around that time lidia briefly moved offshore before making another landfall near punta abreojos a few hours later by that time lidia had weakened steadily and emerged over the pacific ocean on september 2 however lidia continued to weaken due to cold sea surface temperatures after failing to produce deep convection for about 12–15 hours the nhc declared that lidia had

mid-level circulation survived and eventually spawned an area of low pressure off the coast of mexico on september 11 the system organized into tropical depression fifteen-e during the next several days the depression slowly drifted westward before strengthening into tropical storm otis on september 16 while only marginal strengthening was forecast otis unexpectedly rapidly intensified into a category 2 hurricane by 17 00 utc on september 17 despite lower ocean temperatures drier air and increased wind shear 116 otis continued to intensify into a category 3 major hurricane by 03 00 utc on

september 14 the system was noted to develop a well-defined center and spiral banding 133 this led to the formation of tropical storm norma skipping tropical depression status 134 the newly formed tropical storm continued to intensify at a steady pace while it moved slowly northward becoming a category 1 hurricane by 03 00 utc on september 16 and reaching winds of 75 mph 120 km h 135 at this time warnings were being required for the southern portions of the baja california peninsula as norma was forecast to become a major hurricane and make landfall in the area 136 however its broad circulation and the entrainment of dry air quickly became an impediment in doing so 137 norma then weakened back to a tropical storm at 21 00 utc later that day while becoming stationary though a developing ridge over mexico began to move the storm slowly towards the north 138 norma maintained its intensity the next day and continued being slowly steered by the ridge towards a northwesterly to west-northwesterly path all tropical storm warnings were discontinued as norma started to shift its track more to the west 139 the cyclone continued weakening for several days as it slowly drifted to

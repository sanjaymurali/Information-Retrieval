the windward islands and passing over tobago and it reached maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour 233 km h in the caribbean the storm struck southwestern haiti near peak intensity turned to the west and drifted over cuba for four days before turning to the northeast flora passed over the bahamas and accelerated northeastward becoming an extratropical cyclone on october 12 due to its slow movement across cuba flora is the wettest known tropical cyclone for cuba haiti and the dominican republic 1 the significant casualties caused by flora were the most for a tropical cyclone in the atlantic basin since the 1900 galveston hurricane 2 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a disturbance in the intertropical convergence zone organized into a tropical depression on september 26 while located about 755 miles 1,215 km southwest of the island of fogo in the cape verde islands upon forming the depression had a poorly organized circulation with banding features to its north and east the depression moved west-northwestward and the system failed to organize significantly by a day after developing on september 27 the banding features dissipated though the area of convection around the center increased satellite imagery was unavailable until september 30 during which there were not sufficient ship reports to indicate the presence of a low-level circulation the depression continued west-northwestward and it is estimated it intensified into tropical storm flora on september 29 while located about 560 miles 900 km east-southeast of trinidad or about 350 miles 560 km north of cayenne french guiana operationally advisories were not initiated until a day later 2 flora quickly intensified after it became a tropical storm and early on september 30 it attained hurricane status later that day reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the existence of the hurricane with the flight reporting a well-defined circular 8-mile 13 km wide eye one observer noted flora to be the best organized tropical cyclone over the previous two years after attaining major hurricane status flora passed directly over the island of tobago late on the 30th with winds of 120 mph 190 km h the hurricane continued west-northwestward as it entered the caribbean and early on october 2 its winds reached 140 miles per hour 230 km h thirty hours later flora intensified slightly further and attained peak winds of 145 mph 233 km h while located about 105 miles 169 km south of the border of haiti

quickly weakening to a 120 mph 190 km h hurricane flora turned more to the west in the windward passage and restrengthened slightly to strike southeastern cuba about 30 miles 48 km east of guantanamo bay with winds of 125 mph 201 km h a high pressure system to its north turned the motion of the hurricane to a westward drift causing it to weaken quickly over land flora neared the north coast of cuba on october 4 before turning to the south it executed a cyclonic loop and entered the coastal waters off granma province an anticyclone to the west of flora turned the hurricane to the north bringing it ashore near santa cruz del sur on october 7 with winds of around 90 mph 140 km h flora initially turned southeastward over central cuba and late on october 8 a short-wave trough turned the hurricane northeastward bringing it into the coastal waters of the holguín province 2 flora remained a hurricane while drifting over land due to abundant moisture and a favorable upper level environment 3 after passing over the southeastern bahamas early on october 9 flora began to restrengthen and on october 10 it again reached major hurricane status while located 290 miles 470 km south of bermuda the hurricane gradually weakened as it continued northeastward and weakened to a category 1 hurricane on october 11 flora gradually lost its convection over the north atlantic ocean and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on october 12 while located 270 miles 430 km east-southeast of cape race newfoundland the extratropical remnant dissipated the next day 2 preparations edit the weather bureau in san juan puerto rico issued a hurricane warning for trinidad tobago and the grenadines south of saint vincent in the cyclone s first advisory on hurricane flora gale warnings were later issued for islands off northern venezuela 3 and from saint vincent northward to martinique advisories on flora emphasized the danger of the hurricane and advised preparations to be rushed

sections of several towns while mudslides buried some entire towns 2 resulting in many deaths heavy rainfall led to river flooding along the grisse river which crested at 14 feet 4.3 m above normal the flood waters created new channels and washed away entire banana plantations 32 in most areas crops were entirely destroyed 2 the coffee crop was harvested prior to the arrival of the hurricane though heavy rainfall and severe flooding ruined the crop for later years additionally strong winds downed shading trees for the coffee crop on the southern peninsula one official estimated it would require three years for the coffee crop to be replanted and regrown 32 strong winds in southwestern haiti from the hurricane damaged or destroyed hundreds of trees the path of flora over the area was

for food 38 the passage of the hurricane reduced the height of the rainforest canopy above 800 feet 240 m by half twenty-five years passed before the canopy reached its previous height 39 in the dominican republic damage reports were largely unknown by a month after the hurricane passed the island primarily in the western provinces there roads were still impassable large areas remained

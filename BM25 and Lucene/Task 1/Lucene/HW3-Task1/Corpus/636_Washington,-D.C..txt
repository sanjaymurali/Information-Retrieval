residence act on july 16 1790 approved the creation of a capital district located along the potomac river on the country s east coast the u.s constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the congress and the district is therefore not a part of any state the states of maryland and virginia each donated land to form the federal district which included the pre-existing settlements of georgetown and alexandria named in honor of president george washington the city of washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital in 1846 congress returned the land originally ceded by virginia in 1871 it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the district washington had an estimated population of 681,170 as of july

foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many international organizations trade unions non-profit organizations lobbying groups and professional associations a locally elected mayor and a 13‑member council have governed the district since 1973 however the congress maintains supreme authority over the city and may overturn local laws d.c residents elect a non-voting at-large congressional delegate to the house of representatives but the district has no representation in the senate the district receives three electoral votes in presidential elections as permitted by the twenty-third amendment to the united states constitution ratified in 1961 history further information history of washington d.c and timeline of washington d.c various tribes of the algonquian-speaking piscataway people also known as the conoy inhabited the lands around the potomac river when europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century one group known as the nacotchtank also called the nacostines by catholic missionaries maintained settlements around the anacostia river within the present-day district of columbia conflicts with european colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the piscataway people some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near point of rocks maryland 5 in his federalist no 43 published january 23 1788 james madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety 6 five years earlier a band of unpaid soldiers besieged congress while its members were meeting in philadelphia known as the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783 the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security 7 article one section eight of the constitution permits the establishment of a district not exceeding ten miles square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states 8 however the constitution does not specify a location for the capital in what is now known as the compromise of 1790 madison alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each state s remaining revolutionary war debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the southern united states 9 a foundation map of the district of columbia in 1835 prior to the retrocession on july 9 1790 congress passed the residence act which approved the creation of a national capital on the potomac river the exact location was to be selected by president george washington who signed the bill into law on july 16 formed from land donated by the states of maryland and virginia the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles 16 km on each side totaling 100 square miles 259 km2 10 b two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory the port of georgetown maryland founded in 1751 11 and the city of alexandria virginia founded in 1749 12 during 1791–92 andrew ellicott and several assistants including a free african american astronomer named benjamin banneker surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point 13 many of the stones are still standing 14 a new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the potomac to the east of georgetown on september 9 1791 the three commissioners overseeing the capital s construction named the city in honor of president washington the federal district was named columbia which was a poetic name for the united states commonly in use at that time 15 16 congress held its first session in washington on november 17 1800 17 congress passed the organic act of 1801 which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government further the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties the county of washington to the east of the potomac and the county of alexandria to the west 18 after the passage of this act citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of maryland or virginia which therefore ended their representation in congress 19 ford s theatre in the 19th century site of the 1865 assassination of president lincoln on august 24–25 1814 in a raid known as the burning of washington british forces invaded the capital during the war of 1812 the capitol treasury and white house were burned and gutted during the attack 20 most government buildings were repaired quickly however the capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868 21 retrocession and the civil war see also district of columbia retrocession and washington d.c. in the american civil war in the 1830s the district s southern territory of alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by congress 22 the city of alexandria was a major market in the american slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in congress would end slavery in the district further depressing the economy alexandria s citizens petitioned virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession 23 the virginia general assembly voted in february 1846 to accept the return of alexandria and on july 9 1846 congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by virginia therefore the district s current area consists only of the portion originally donated by maryland 22 confirming the fears of pro-slavery alexandrians the compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district although not slavery itself 24 the outbreak of the american civil war in 1861 led to expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the district s population including a large influx of freed slaves 25 president abraham lincoln signed the compensated emancipation act in 1862 which ended slavery in the district of columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons nine months prior to the emancipation proclamation 26 in 1868 congress granted the district s african american male residents the right to vote in municipal elections 25 growth and redevelopment crowds surrounding the reflecting pool during the 1963 march on washington by 1870 the district s population had grown 75 from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents 27 despite the city s growth washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation some members of congress suggested moving the capital further west but president ulysses s grant refused to consider such a proposal 28 congress passed the organic act of 1871 which repealed the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown and created a new territorial government for the whole district of columbia 29 president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd to the position of governor in 1873 shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized washington but ultimately bankrupted the district government in 1874 congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners 30 the city s first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and generated growth in areas of the district beyond the city of washington s original boundaries washington s urban plan was expanded throughout the district in the following decades 31 georgetown was formally annexed by the city of washington in 1895 32 however the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works washington was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the city beautiful movement in the early 1900s 33 increased federal spending as a result of the new deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings memorials and museums in washington 34 world war ii further increased government activity adding to the number of federal employees in the capital 35 by 1950 the district s population reached its peak of 802,178 residents 27 civil rights and home rule era the twenty-third amendment to the united states constitution was ratified in 1961 granting the district three votes in the electoral college for the election of president and vice president but still no voting representation in congress 36 after the assassination of civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr. on april 4 1968 riots broke out in the district primarily in the u street 14th street 7th street and h street corridors centers of black residential and commercial areas the riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops stopped the violence many stores and other buildings were burned rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s 37 in 1973 congress enacted the district of columbia home rule act providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district 38 in 1975 walter washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the district 39 on september 11 2001 terrorists hijacked american airlines flight 77 and deliberately crashed the plane into the

l enfant plan for the federal capital city washington d.c. is a planned city in 1791 president washington commissioned pierre peter charles l enfant a french-born architect and city planner to design the new capital he enlisted scottish surveyor alexander ralston helped layout the city plan 75 the l enfant plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles providing room for open space and landscaping 76 he based his design on plans of cities such as paris amsterdam karlsruhe and milan that thomas jefferson had sent to him 77 l enfant s design also envisioned a garden-lined grand avenue approximately 1 mile 1.6 km in length and 400 feet 120 m wide in the area that is now the national mall 78 l enfant plan for washington d.c. as revised by andrew ellicott in 1792 president washington dismissed l enfant in march 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital s construction andrew ellicott who had worked with l enfant surveying the city was then tasked with completing the design though ellicott made revisions to the original plans including changes to some street patterns l enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city 79 by the early 1900s l enfant s vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings including a railroad station on the national mall congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying washington s ceremonial core 33 what became known as the mcmillan plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall clearing slums and establishing a new citywide park system the plan is thought to have largely preserved l enfant s intended design 76 the construction of the 12-story cairo apartment building in 1894 spurred the city s first building height restrictions by law washington s skyline is low and sprawling the federal heights of buildings act of 1910 allows buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street plus 20 feet 6.1 m 80 despite popular belief no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the united states capitol or the 555-foot 169 m washington monument 52 which remains the district s tallest structure city leaders have criticized the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused by urban sprawl 80 the district is divided into four quadrants of unequal area northwest nw northeast ne southeast se and southwest sw the axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the u.s capitol building 81 all road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the capitol most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters e.g. c street sw north–south streets with numbers e.g. 4th street nw and diagonal avenues many of which are named after states 81 the city of washington was bordered by boundary street to the north renamed florida avenue in 1890 rock creek to the west and the anacostia river to the east 31 76 washington s street grid was extended where possible throughout the district starting in 1888 82 georgetown s streets were renamed in 1895 32 some streets are particularly noteworthy such as pennsylvania avenue which connects the white house to the capitol and k street which houses the offices of many lobbying groups 83 washington hosts 177 foreign embassies constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1,600 residential properties owned by foreign countries many of which are on a section of massachusetts avenue informally known as embassy row 84 architecture the white house ranked second on the aia

architecture are in the district of columbia 85 the white house the washington national cathedral the thomas jefferson memorial the united states capitol the lincoln memorial and the vietnam veterans memorial the neoclassical georgian gothic and modern architectural styles are all reflected among those six structures and many other prominent edifices in washington notable exceptions include buildings constructed in the french second empire style such as the eisenhower executive office building 86 outside downtown washington architectural styles are even more varied historic buildings are designed primarily in the queen anne châteauesque richardsonian romanesque georgian revival beaux-arts and a variety of victorian styles rowhouses are especially prominent in areas developed after the civil war and typically follow federalist and late victorian designs 87 georgetown s old stone house was built in 1765 making it the oldest-standing original building in the city 88 founded in 1789

seasons 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 the 2005 atlantic hurricane season was the most active atlantic hurricane season in recorded history shattering numerous records the impact of the season was widespread and ruinous with an estimated 3,913 deaths and record damage of about 159.2 billion of the storms that made landfall five of the season s seven major hurricanes—dennis emily katrina rita and wilma—were responsible for most of the destruction stan was the most destructive storm that was not a major hurricane the mexican states of quintana roo and yucatán and the us states of florida and louisiana were each struck twice by major hurricanes cuba the bahamas haiti mississippi texas alabama and tamaulipas were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least one more the most catastrophic effects of the season were felt on the united states gulf coast where a 30 ft 10 m storm surge from hurricane katrina caused devastating flooding that destroyed most structures on the mississippi coastline subsequent levee failures in new orleans louisiana caused by the storm crippled the city furthermore hurricane stan combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides across central america with guatemala being hardest-hit the 2005 season was the first to observe more tropical storms and hurricanes in the atlantic than the west pacific on average the latter experiences 26 tropical storms while the atlantic only averages 12 this event was repeated in the 2010 season however the 2010 typhoon season broke the record for the fewest storms observed in a single year while the 2005 typhoon season featured near average activity the season officially began on june 1 2005 and lasted until november 30 although it effectively persisted into january 2006 due to continued storm activity a record twenty-eight tropical and subtropical storms formed of which a record fifteen became hurricanes of these a record seven strengthened into major hurricanes a record-tying five became category 4 hurricanes and a record four reached category 5 strength the highest categorization for hurricanes on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale among these category 5 storms were hurricanes katrina and wilma respectively the costliest and the most intense by lowest pressure atlantic hurricanes on record this season was also notable because the list of storm names was used up and six greek letter names had to be used seasonal forecasts edit predictions of tropical activity in the 2005 season source date tropical storms hurricanes major hurricanes csu average

csu and separately by forecasters with the u.s government s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa prior to and during the 2005 season gray issued four forecasts each time increasing the predicted level of activity the noaa issued two forecasts one shortly before the season and one two months into the season drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release nonetheless all forecasts fell far short of the actual activity of the season preseason forecasts edit on december 3 2004 gray s team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2005 season predicting a slightly above-average season additionally the team predicted a greatly increased chance of a major hurricane striking the east coast of the united states and the florida peninsula though the forecast predicted above-average activity the level predicted was significantly less than the 2004 season 1 on april 1 2005 after confirming that el niño conditions would not develop gray and his team revised the december forecast upward expecting 13 tropical storms instead of 11 and seven hurricanes instead of six in addition the chance of a storm impacting the united states was raised slightly 3 on may 16 2005 16 days before the season began noaa issued its outlook for the 2005 season forecasting a 70 chance of above-normal activity the accumulated cyclone energy ace value for the season was predicted to be 120–190 of the median ace of 87.5 × 104 kt2 4 shortly thereafter on may 31 the day before the season officially began gray s team revised its april forecast upwards to 15 named storms 8 hurricanes and 4 major hurricanes 5 midseason outlook edit on august 2 after an extraordinarily active early season the noaa released an updated outlook on the remainder of the season significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about double those of a normal season the ace value was now forecast to be 180 to 270 of the median the noaa also noted a higher than normal confidence in the forecast of above-normal activity 6 on august 5 2005 gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated forecast it was consistent with noaa s update 7 although neither the noaa nor gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity even the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level of activity the actual ace would prove to be 248 × 104 kt2 8  —

landfall in veracruz the next morning the storm damaged hundreds of homes and caused flooding which killed two people 11 hurricane cindy formed in the gulf of mexico on july 4 originally thought to be a tropical storm cindy made landfall in louisiana on july 5 as a minimal hurricane dropping up to five in 130 mm of rain spawning several tornadoes flooding some coastal areas including coden alabama and killing three people cindy was upgraded to a hurricane in the post-storm analysis 12 13 satellite photo of hurricane emily near peak intensity on july 5 hurricane dennis formed in the eastern caribbean it crossed grenada before intensifying into a category 4 hurricane the strongest ever recorded in july with a pressure of 930 mbar hpa dennis struck cuba at full force then made a final landfall on the florida panhandle the hurricane killed 89 people mostly in haiti and caused 4– 6 billion 2005 usd 4.91 billion – 7.36 billion 2017 usd in damage in cuba and the united states 14 15 soon thereafter hurricane emily formed in the atlantic on july 11 it entered the caribbean sea and quickly intensified to a category 4 storm breaking dennis s record for july intensity when its pressure reached 929 mbar hpa emily then briefly reached category 5 intensity—the earliest such storm ever recorded in the atlantic emily crossed the yucatán peninsula at category 4 strength before hitting tamaulipas at category 3 strength emily killed at least 14 people over the course of its path an estimated 400 million 2005 usd 491 million 2017 usd in damage was reported 16 tropical storm franklin formed off the bahamas on july 18 the storm moved northeast and became extratropical off the coast of atlantic canada without ever having threatened land 17 tropical storm gert followed soon after on july 24 gert struck veracruz near where emily had hit a few days before roughly 1,000 people were evacuated for fear of flooding but no damage or deaths were reported 18 august edit like july august also got off to a fast start tropical storm harvey formed southwest of bermuda on august 3 harvey dropped some rain on bermuda as it moved to the northeast it became extratropical on august 8 in the open atlantic ocean 19 the tropical depression that would become hurricane irene formed west of the cape verde islands on august 4 the system moved west and north and did not reach hurricane strength until august 14 at which point it became the second cape verde-type hurricane of the season irene turned northeast and briefly reached category 2 status before weakening and becoming extratropical on august 18 it never posed a threat to land 20 eye of hurricane katrina as seen from a noaa hurricane hunter p-3 aircraft tropical depression ten formed east of the lesser antilles on august 13 the system dissipated the next day its remnants soon merged with another system and eventually contributed to the formation of hurricane katrina 21 tropical storm jose followed forming in the bay of campeche on august 22 it strengthened rapidly but quickly reached the coast and made landfall in the mexican state of veracruz on august 23 preventing further strengthening jose forced 25,000 people to evacuate their homes in veracruz and killed six people in the state of oaxaca two more were reported missing 22 in all damage in mexico amounted to 45 million 2005 usd 55.2 million

hurricane intensity before making landfall in south florida as a minimal hurricane a few hours later the storm entered the gulf of mexico and intensified rapidly into a category 5 hurricane while crossing the loop current on august 28 katrina made landfall shortly after 06 00 cst on august 29 near the mouth of the mississippi river as an extremely large category 3 hurricane category 5-level storm surges as the storm had weakened only in the previous several hours caused catastrophic damage along the coastlines of louisiana mississippi and alabama within hours levees separating lake pontchartrain from new orleans louisiana were breached by the surge ultimately flooding about 80 of the city wind damage was reported well inland impeding relief efforts katrina is estimated to be responsible for at least 108 billion 2005 usd 132 billion in 2017 usd in damage breaking hurricane andrew s record in 1992 and making it the costliest natural disaster in u.s history it was the deadliest u.s hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane killing at least 1,836 people the 1900 galveston hurricane remains the deadliest natural disaster in united states history with a death toll of approximately 6,000 24 25 on august 24 a vigorous tropical wave developed off the coast of africa which eventually spawned an area of low pressure the low gradually became better organized and was designated tropical depression thirteen on august 28 about midway between the lesser antilles and africa however northerly wind shear prevented the depression from strengthening and it degenerated into a broad low-pressure area the next day after traveling rapidly towards the north the low regenerated into a tropical depression and shortly after was declared tropical storm lee on august 31 lee was only briefly a tropical storm before it weakened back to a tropical depression the depression degenerated into a broad low-pressure area again before being absorbed by a cold front on september 4 26 september edit hurricane ophelia off the coast of north carolina hurricane maria led off the month of september and formed into a tropical storm well east of the leeward islands on september 2 maria reached its peak as a category 3 hurricane on september 5 turning northeast and weakening before becoming extratropical on september 10 unusually this extratropical storm strengthened as it moved toward iceland its remnants struck norway where one person was killed in a landslide 27 hurricane nate formed southwest of bermuda on september 5 and moved northeast as it strengthened into a strong category 1 hurricane nate became extratropical on september 10 the storm never approached land although it did interfere with canadian naval vessels en route to the gulf coast to help in katrina relief efforts 28 hurricane ophelia formed as a tropical depression in the bahamas on september 6 and almost immediately made landfall on grand bahama it became a tropical storm off the coast of florida before strengthening into a large category 1 storm and raking a long stretch of the southern north carolina coast with heavy winds and storm surge on september 12 and september 13 the hurricane s eye never made landfall and moved back out to sea before becoming extratropical on september 17 and striking atlantic canada total damage estimates were around 70 million 2005 usd 29 hurricane philippe formed east of the leeward islands on september 17 it moved northwards reaching category 1 intensity before weakening and dissipating on september 23 no landmasses were affected although bermuda s lowest pressure of september was recorded after philippe passed near the island 30 infrared image of hurricane rita near peak strength hurricane rita formed as a tropical storm over the turks and caicos islands on september 18 the storm reached category 2 intensity as it moved south of the florida keys on september 20 rapid intensification ensued as rita moved into the gulf of mexico and rita became a category 5 hurricane on september 21 becoming the third now fourth most intense hurricane ever recorded in the atlantic basin rita made landfall near the texas-louisiana border on september 24 major flooding was reported in port arthur and beaumont texas while cameron and calcasieu parishes in louisiana were devastated offshore oil platforms throughout rita s path also suffered significant damage six people are confirmed dead from rita s direct effects and total damage from the storm is estimated at about 10 billion 2005 usd 12.3 billion 2017 usd one hundred and thirteen indirect deaths were reported mostly from the exodus from houston texas and surrounding counties 31 32 tropical depression nineteen formed west of the cape verde islands on september 30 but dissipated on october 2 without having threatened land 33 october edit hurricane stan shortly before landfall in veracruz hurricane stan was the first october storm reaching tropical storm status on october 2 just before crossing the yucatán peninsula in the bay of campeche stan briefly reached hurricane strength before making landfall south of veracruz veracruz on october 4 stan was a part of a large system of rainstorms which dropped torrential rainfall that caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides over southern mexico and central america well over 1,000 total deaths were caused by the flooding of which 80–100 are directly attributed to stan 34 an initially unnoticed unnamed subtropical storm was discovered by the nhc during the postseason analysis this short-lived subtropical storm formed on october 4 south of the azores and was absorbed by an extratropical low the next day after passing over those islands 35 tropical storm tammy led a brief existence before making landfall in northeastern florida on october 5 tammy dropped heavy rains over portions of the southeast united states before merging with a frontal system that would eventually cause the northeast u.s flooding of october 2005 36 37 subtropical depression twenty-two formed southeast of bermuda on october 8 it dissipated the next day although its remnants approached new england and contributed to the northeast u.s flooding of october 2005 38 hurricane vince formed over unfavorably cold water in the east atlantic near the madeira islands on october 8 as a subtropical storm this hurricane was first recorded by the nhc on october 9 when it became tropical and shortly thereafter it briefly strengthened into a hurricane the storm made an even more unusual landfall in spain on october 11 making it the first tropical cyclone to impact spain since the 1842 spain hurricane 39 hurricane wilma formed on october 17 in the western caribbean southwest of jamaica and rapidly strengthened on october 19 it became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the atlantic basin with 185 mph 295 km h winds and a central pressure of 882 millibars 26.0 inhg it then moved slowly and struck quintana roo on october 22 as a category 4 hurricane causing very heavy damage to cancún and cozumel likewise after emerging into the gulf of mexico wilma sharply changed directions and passed north of cuba before striking southern florida on the 24th as a category 3 storm then moving into the atlantic ocean and becoming extratropical wilma is directly credited with 23 deaths total damage is estimated at around 29 billion 2005 usd 35.6 billion 2017 usd mostly in the united states mexico and cuba 40 tropical storm alpha formed in the eastern caribbean on october 22 and crossed hispaniola causing major flooding before merging with wilma a total of 42 people are reported dead from the storm in haiti and the dominican republic 41 hurricane beta formed in the southern caribbean on october 26 and strengthened into a category 3 hurricane before making landfall in the colombian islands of san andrés providencia and in nicaragua on october 30 42 as of 2012 hurricane beta was responsible for nine fatalities and more than 15.5 million in damage across four countries november december and january 2006 edit hurricane epsilon viewed from the international space station tropical activity declined very slowly as the season wound down tropical storm gamma initially formed on november 15 in the central caribbean and degenerated into a tropical wave before reforming although the storm dissipated on november 20 after having made landfall in northern honduras rainfall from gamma caused 41 deaths in honduras and belize 43 tropical storm delta formed in the eastern atlantic on november 23 it approached but never attained hurricane strength delta became extratropical on november 28 shortly before striking the canary islands at full force causing seven deaths and toppling el dedo de dios a famous land formation on gran canaria 44 hurricane epsilon formed as a tropical storm on november 29 in a hostile environment in the middle of the atlantic it reached hurricane strength on december 2 and defied forecasting by persisting for over a week before dissipating 45 tropical storm zeta became the final storm of the season when it formed on december 30 six hours short of tying the record of hurricane alice of 1954 as the latest-forming named storm in a season zeta dissipated on january 6 2006 having become the longest-lived january tropical cyclone in atlantic basin history 46 deaths and damage edit see also 2005 atlantic hurricane season statistics damage in navarre beach florida from hurricane dennis the storms of the season were extraordinarily damaging and were responsible for significant loss of life total damage is estimated to be about 159.2 billion 2005 us and an estimated 2,067 people were confirmed dead however due to uncertainties in the death toll caused by stan the death toll from the season could be as high as 4,000 people 47 the hardest-hit area was the united states gulf coast from eastern texas to the florida panhandle first to strike the area was hurricane dennis which caused 2.23 billion in damage along the florida panhandle 14 hurricane katrina caused catastrophic damage to the gulf coast devastating a long stretch of coast along louisiana mississippi and alabama with a 30-foot 9 m storm surge wind damage was reported well inland slowing down recovery efforts storm surge also breached levees in the city of new orleans louisiana flooding about 80 of the city total damage has been estimated at 108 billion and at least 1,836 people were killed by the storm katrina is by far the costliest hurricane in u.s history surpassing 1992 s hurricane andrew and the deadliest hurricane in the u.s since 1928 24 48 49 hurricane rita struck near the same area re-flooded new orleans though to a far less degree than katrina and caused extensive damage along the coastlines of louisiana and texas total damage is estimated at about 12 billion 50 tropical storm arlene and hurricane cindy also struck the gulf coast but caused much lighter damage 9 12 flooding in new orleans from hurricane katrina the mexican state of quintana roo was also heavily hit suffering billions of dollars in damage when hurricanes emily and wilma both made landfall between cozumel and cancún wilma was particularly devastating lashing the area with major hurricane-force winds for over a full day and was possibly the most damaging hurricane in mexican history 40 wilma caused widespread heavy damage in south florida causing 20.6 billion in damage total in the united states 51 hurricanes katrina and rita had struck the same area earlier causing lesser but still significant damage and tropical storm arlene killed one person caught in a rip current 9 hurricane dennis also brushed the area on its track northward 14 in october the remnants of tropical storm tammy and subtropical depression twenty-two met over the northeastern united states causing intense flooding 38 southeastern north carolina suffered some damage from the slow-moving hurricane ophelia damage from that storm were originally estimated at 1.6 billion but finalized at only 70 million the remainder of the atlantic coast escaped the major storms although some regions were affected by the remnants of several storms including katrina ophelia tammy subtropical depression twenty-two and wilma 29 northeastern mexico including veracruz and tamaulipas was struck repeatedly hurricane emily struck tamaulipas directly causing severe damage tropical storms bret gert and jose also made landfall in the area but caused minimal damage although they did cause 12 deaths 22 southern mexico along with portions of central america suffered heavy flooding and mudslides from hurricane stan and nearby nontropical rains over 1,600 people were confirmed dead in total with some towns completely wiped out though most of these deaths were not directly related to the hurricane central america also suffered flooding from tropical storm gamma and hurricane wilma and nicaragua was struck directly by hurricane beta gamma caused 13–18 million 2005 usd in damage to crops no damage figures are available for any of the other storms 47 the island of hispaniola escaped the worst storms however at least 89 people were killed in haiti from the effects of hurricanes dennis and wilma and tropical storm alpha the leeward islands were generally spared all the storms 47 although dennis and emily caused significant damage in the windward islands 47 cuba was struck by hurricane dennis at peak strength causing 1.4 billion in damage it was the worst hurricane to hit cuba in over 40 years some areas of cuba also suffered heavy damage from hurricanes rita and wilma 14 unusual impacts were felt in europe and nearby islands from four storms hurricane maria intensified and affected northern europe as a vicious extratropical storm while hurricane vince maintained tropical characteristics onto the iberian peninsula as a weak tropical depression tropical storm delta struck the canary islands just after becoming extratropical causing extensive damage before reaching morocco as a weak extratropical system in addition the azores were affected by the unnamed subtropical storm at its peak strength eight people were killed by those storms and significant damage was reported as a result of maria and delta although no figures are available 47 economic impact edit hurricane rita at landfall along with the location of several refineries the damage had far-reaching economic consequences due to vulnerability of both oil extracting and refining capacity in the gulf of mexico storms led to speculative spikes in the price of crude oil whereas the damage to refinery capacity in the united states caused gasoline to soar to record prices even adjusted for inflation governments in europe and the united states tapped strategic reserves of gasoline and petroleum and shortages were reported in the days after katrina in areas heavily dependent on the gulf of mexico for refined gasoline even weeks after the storm prices remained elevated as the shortage in production remained over 1 million barrels 160,000 m3 per day 24 rita damaged wells in the western gulf of mexico which were primarily exploratory leading to concerns that future production would be damped for some time to come additionally as the storm churned in the gulf forecasters predicted that it would strike houston texas the location of many major oil refineries that survived katrina leading to additional spikes in oil prices before the predictions changed in georgia governor sonny perdue declared snow days on september 26 and september 27 2005 at all georgia public schools to conserve fuel for school buses in anticipation of rita s impact however as the storm veered away from houston shortly before landfall damage to refining capacity was not as great as feared 31 agriculture in multiple countries was hard hit by extremely heavy rains from severe storms during the season early in the season hurricane dennis caused significant damage to various citrus and vegetable crops in cuba though the damage was not crippling 14 in central america hurricane stan and associated nontropical storms dropped upwards of 20 inches 500 mm of rain causing in addition to severe flash floods and mud slides heavy damage to crops especially to the banana and coffee crops which were nearly ready to be harvested this caused significant economic disruption in guatemala and surrounding nations as the rural economies are highly dependent on the coffee and banana crops 34 when hurricane beta struck nicaragua later in the season it also caused heavy damage to the banana crop but the harvests had already ended mitigating economic disruption 42 katrina also had significant political consequences as president george w bush louisiana governor kathleen blanco and new orleans mayor ray nagin all came under heavy criticism for what were considered sluggish or inappropriate responses to hurricane katrina on december 14 2005 congressional hearings began to investigate whether these claims had any merit in addition michael brown head of the united states federal emergency management agency fema was forced to resign from his post after the organization came under fire for what was perceived as an insufficient response to katrina 52 forecasting uncertainty edit hurricane vince formed in cold waters in the northeast atlantic a number of storms that formed in 2005 exhibited unusual behavior and challenged forecasters ability to make correct predictions hurricane vince formed farther northeast in the atlantic than any other tropical cyclone on record at the time—only 2009 s grace has formed farther north—and then unexpectedly reached hurricane strength over waters considered too cold to support a hurricane 39 hurricane wilma became the fastest-intensifying hurricane on record and later strengthened unexpectedly in the face of strong wind shear 53 tropical storm delta hurricane epsilon and tropical storm zeta all formed over the cold waters of the late-season eastern atlantic much like hurricane vince though at lower latitudes all three persisted in the face of heavy wind shear and epsilon managed to reach hurricane strength over waters well below the temperatures previously thought necessary for hurricane formation epsilon became the longest-lasting december hurricane 45 while zeta became the longest-lasting storm in january 46 records and notable events edit the 2005 season broke numerous records for tropical cyclone activity 54 though it might not actually be the most active season in history since records before 1944 are incomplete 55 number of storms edit storm formation during the 2005 season systems average old record 2005 storms 10 21 28 hurricanes 6 12 15 category 3

hurricanes major hurricanes and category 5 hurricanes formed during the season than in any previously recorded atlantic season the season was the first season to use v and w names and when the season ran out of official alphabetical names after the use of wilma forecasters resorted to using letters from the greek alphabet for the first time although alpha and delta had been used for subtropical storms in the 1970s almost every storm in 2005 set a record for early formation of the twenty-eight storms which formed twenty-two of them qualified as the earliest-forming storm of that number starting with hurricane dennis almost every storm was such the record set by dennis was later broken by debby in 2012 which was again broken in 2016 with danielle citation needed the season s activity was reflected with a very high cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 250 this total ranks it as the second-most active season on record with only the 1933 season having a higher ace value 56 ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength although officially subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total 57 the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase intense storms edit hurricane wilma near peak intensity of 882 mbar 26.0 inhg three out of six most intense hurricanes recorded in 2005 topped off by hurricane wilma s 882 mbar 26.0 inhg minimum pressure shattering the 17-year-old record set by hurricane gilbert 40 hurricanes emily katrina and rita also attained category 5 intensity and hurricanes rita and katrina became the fourth and sixth-most intense recorded atlantic storms respectively hurricane emily was not originally recorded as a category 5 storm but it was upgraded into the post-storm status by the national hurricane center 16 the 2005 season is the only season on record with four category 5 storms on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale

emily was also the first category 5 hurricane ever recorded in july and the earliest by nearly three weeks beating hurricane allen the high level of activity and strength was reflected in the
